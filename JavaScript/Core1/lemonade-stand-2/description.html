 <section id="shortDescription">
  <p>A lemonade seller makes lemonade in pitchers and sells it in paper cups at a stand in a street market.
   Each day consists of the following process steps and phases:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>The day starts with making planning decisions (demand forecasting, production planning and sales price planning)
    and ordering the required materials (lemons, sugar, water, ice cubes, paper cups).</li>
   <li>Some time later, the planned quantity of lemonade is produced, the sales price is decided and
    the stand is opened.</li>
   <li>Then, customers arrive randomly and order a cup of lemonade. As long as there is still lemonade in stock,
    customer orders are served.</li>
   <li>At the end of the day, the lemonade stand is closed and the remaining lemonade and expired input items are dumped.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A lemonade stand can be modeled in a generic way as an instance of a <em>single product manufacturing company</em> 
    that uses an input inventory and transforms <em>input items</em> into an <em>output item</em> (the product). We make a series of three 
    increasingly complex models of lemonade stands:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>In the basic model, <a href='../lemonade-stand-1/'>Lemonade-Stand-1</a>, we build a scenario with just one lemonade stand (a monopoly) and we abstract away from market conditions,
    customers and individual customer orders as well as from suppliers, individual replenishment orders and corresponding deliveries, 
	inventory management, marketing activities and competition. Customer orders are aggregated into a daily demand quantity. 
	An aggregate replenishment order is directly converted into a corresponding daily delivery. Due to just-in-time deliveries
	there is no need for inventory management.</li>
    <li>In the Lemonade-Stand-2 model, we consider individual deliveries (with random lead times),
	 inventory management (with perishable items) and market conditions dominated by the weather.</li>
    <li>In the third model, we consider individual customers and we build a scenario with several lemonade stands
      that compete with each other.</li>

 <details><summary>Background</summary>
  <p>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_Stand'>Lemonade Stand Game</a> was developed in 1973 by Bob Jamison for mainframe
   computers and was later ported to the Apple II platform in 1979 and distributed by Apple throughout the 1980s.

 <details><summary>Simulation Design</summary>
  <p>It is assumed that the day starts at 8 am with demand forecasting (based on the weather forecast), production planning 
   and ordering materials for restocking the inventory. Due to random lead times, the replenishment orders result in deliveries on
   the same day or on one of the following days at 2 pm.
   The planned product quantity is produced and, depending on the weather, the sales price is decided at 11 am. Abstracting away 
   from individual purchase events, customer demand is aggregated in a daily demand event at 5 pm.
   Finally, the business day ends at 6 pm with dumping the remaining lemonade and the expired input items.</p>
  <p>Following the <a href="https://articles.jsime.org/1/1"><em>Object Event Modeling and Simulation (OEM&amp;S)</em></a> paradigm, we first model
   the system's object types (defining its state structure) together with its event types in an <em>information model</em>,
   and then the system's dynamics in the form of event rules in a <em>process model</em>.</p>
     <p>The Lemonade-Stand-2 model allows simulation-based active learning of the following topics:</p>
     <ol>
         <li><details><summary>Bill of Materials</summary>
             <p>A <em>Bill of Materials (BoM)</em> defines the composition of a product in the form of a list of component items, each with a quantity,
                 as required for assembling a production unit. In general, a component item may also have a BoM, i.e. be composed of other items, such that a nested
                 composition tree is obatined.</p>
             <p>In the case of a lemonade stand with lemonade as a product, the production unit may be a 3.5 ltr pitcher of lemonade, so we may have the following BoM:</p>
             <pre>{"Lemon": 3, "Water": 2.5, "IceCubes": 20, "Sugar": 0.3}</pre>
         </details></li>
         <li><details><summary>Demand Forecasting</summary>
             <p>The demand of a new day can be forecasted on the basis of the previously recorded daily demand data, which forms
                 a <em>time series</em>. The two most common forecasting methods for time series are the
                 <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411avg.htm#SMA">Simple Moving Average</a> and the
                 <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411avg.htm#SES">Exponentially Weighted Moving Average</a> methods.
                 In the Lemonade-Stand-2 model, the <em>Simple Moving Average</em> method is used.</p>
         </details></li>
         <li><details><summary>Production Planning</summary>
             <p>The production quantity (in number of batches) is planned according to the demand forecast, but under the constraints of using the available input items in stock
                 and the budget available for purchasing additional inpute items.</p>
         </details></li>
         <li><details><summary>Inventory Management</summary>
             <p>Inventory management is one of the big topics in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research">Operations Research</a>,
                 which is a scientific discipline that develops mathematical/analytical methods for decision-making in various application domains. </p>
             <p>The goal of inventory management is to satisfy demand and avoid <em>stock-out</em> events, while minimizing inventory costs.
                 Too much inventory incurs unnecessary holding costs (and capital costs). Not having enough inventory results in stock-outs,
                 impacting the ability to manufacture goods or provide customers with products.</p>
             <p>There are two different replenishment policies used in inventory management:</p>
             <ol>
                 <li>The <em><b>continuous</b> replenishment</em> policy is based on a <em>reorder point</em>, such that a new replenishment order
                     is issued whenever the stock level falls below the reorder point.</li>
                 <li>The <em><b>periodic</b> replenishment</em> policy is based on a <em>reorder interval</em>, such that new replenishment orders
                     are periodically issued whenever the reorder interval time has passed.</li>
             </ol>
             <p>For achieving a certain service level, the reorder point has to be set accordingly. A common approach for setting
                 the reorder point (RP) is based on the concept of <em>safety stock (SS)</em>, which is extra inventory beyond the
                 <em>expected lead time demand ELTD</em> (the expected daily demand multiplied by the expected lead time in days):</p>
             <p>RP = ELTD + SS, with ELTD = E(D) ∗ E(LT)</p>
             <p>Now the question is how to compute the safety stock (on the assumption that both lead time and demand vary independently)?</p>
             <p>A simple approach (the <em>“max – average” method</em>) is to deduct the expected lead time demand from the <em>maximum lead time demand MLT</em>D:</p>

             <div>SS = MLTD - ELTD, with MLTD = E(D) ∗ max(LT),</div>
             <p>which implies that RP = MLTD.</p>
         </details></li>
         <li><details><summary>Sales Price Planning</summary>
             <p>Normally, price planning is based on full costs per product unit, which are computed as fixed costs (mainly labor, and, e.g., depreciation
                 on assets and marketing costs) plus variable costs (mainly input materials). In <em>cost-plus pricing</em>, the product price <i>p</i> is planned by adding
                 a proportional profit to the costs <i>c</i>: <i>p</i> = <i>c</i> + <i>rc</i>  where <i>r</i> is the planned profit rate.</p>
             <p>During favorable market conditions, full costs could be used for cost-plus pricing, while during periods of poor sales (e.g., due to increased competition),
                 marginal costs may be used. The profit rate could be adapted when the <a href="#PED" title="Price Elasticity of Demand">PED</a> of the product is changing.
                 For instance, the lemonade stand could increase its planned profit rate when the weather conditions are sunny and warm, because under such conditions
                 the otherwise very price-elastic demand for lemonade gets more inelastic, thus allowing for price increases without affecting the demand.</p>
         </details></li>
         <li><details id="PED"><summary>Price Elasticity of Demand</summary>
             <p>The <em>Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)</em> is a measure used to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded
                 of a good or service to a change in its price. More precisely, it gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to
                 a one percent change in price (ceteris paribus, i.e. holding constant all the other determinants of demand, such as income).
                 In general, the demand for a good is said to be inelastic when the PED is less than one (in absolute value): that is,
                 changes in price have a relatively small effect on the quantity of the good demanded. The demand for a good is said to be
                 elastic when its PED is greater than one (in absolute value): that is, changes in price have a relatively large effect
                 on the demand quantity of a good.</p>
         </details></li>
     </ol>
  <details><summary>Information Design Model</summary>
     <p>The second version of the LSG model contains the following object types:</p>
     <ol>
       <li><i>SingleProductCompany</i></li>
       <li><i>InputItemType</i> as a subtype of <i>ItemType</i></li>
       <li><i>OutputItemType</i> as a subtype of <i>ItemType</i></li>
     </ol>
       <p>and the following event types:</p>
       <ol>
           <li>StartOfDay</li>
           <li>Delivery</li>
           <li>DailyProduction</li>

     <p>Notice that the <em>bill of materials (BoM)</em> for a product batch is modeled by the the collection-valued property <code>bomItems</code> 
	  where each BoM item is of type <code>BomItem</code>, associating a quantity with an input item type. The collection values of the
	  property <code>bomItems</code> can be implemented in the form of maps where input item type names (such as "Lemon") are the keys and quantities are their values:</p>
     <pre>{"Lemon": 3, "Water": 2.5, "IceCubes": 50, "Sugar": 0.3}</pre>
