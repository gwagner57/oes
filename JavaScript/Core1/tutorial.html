disciplines for investigating specific research questions, in engineering for testing the performance of designs, in education for providing interactive learning experiences, and in entertainment for making games.</p><p>Both static systems/structures and dynamic systems can be modeled and simulated. Modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) of <em>static structures</em>, such as the surface textures of materials, is only an issue in physics and computer graphics, while M&amp;S of dynamic systems is an issue in all scientific and engineering disciplines, including management science, economics and other social sciences.</p><p>A <em>dynamic system</em><a class="role-index-anchor" id="index__I__1"></a> may be subject to discrete or continuous state changes. For simulating a dynamic system one has to model</p><ol><li>the types of objects it is composed of,</li><li>the types of events that cause discrete state changes of objects,</li><li>the discrete state changes of objects caused by the occurrence of an event of some type,</li><li>the follow-up events caused by the occurrence of an event of some type,</li><li>the continuous state changes of objects (described with the help of differential equations).</li></ol><p>A (purely) continuous dynamic system<a class="role-index-anchor" id="index__I__2"></a> does not include events and their causal effects (list items 2-4), but only objects that are subject to continuous state changes (list items 1 and 5). A (purely) discrete dynamic system<a class="role-index-anchor" id="index__I__3"></a> does not include any continuous state changes of objects (list item 5). Many real-world systems include both discrete and continuous state changes, in which case they may be called <em>hybrid</em> dynamic systems.</p><p>In this tutorial, we are only concerned with discrete state changes. Consequently, we only consider purely discrete dynamic systems, also called <em>discrete event systems</em><a class="role-index-anchor" id="index__I__4"></a>, which consist of:</p><ul><li><b>objects</b> (of various types) whose states may be changed by</li><li><b>events</b> (of various types) occurring in a sequence of time points, causing state changes of affected objects and follow-up events.</li></ul><p>This means that for modeling such a system, we have to</p><ol><li>describe its <b>object types</b> and <b>event types</b> (in an <em>information model</em>);</li><li>specify, for any event type, the <b>state changes</b> of objects and the <b>follow-up events</b> caused by the occurrence of an event of that type (in a <em>process model</em>).</li></ol><section class="role-section1" id="CM"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.1</span>. </span>Making a Conceptual Model of the System under Investigation</h2><figure class="right"><img alt="" src="tutorial_files/service-desk.svg" width="200" /></figure><p>Let's look at an example. We model a system of one or more service desks, each of them having its own queue, as a discrete event system:</p><ul><li>Customers arrive at a service desk at random times.</li><li>If there is no other customer in front of them, and the service desk is available, they are served immediately, otherwise they have to queue up in a waiting line.</li><li>The duration of services varies, depending on the individual case.</li><li>When a service is completed, the customer departs and the next customer is served, if there is still any customer in the queue.</li></ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>object types</b> of the system under investigation are:</p><ul><li>customers,</li><li>service desks,</li><li>waiting lines,</li><li>service clerks, if the service is performed by (one or more) clerks.</li></ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>event types</b> are:</p><ul><li>customer arrivals,</li><li>service starts,</li><li>service terminations,</li><li>customer departures.</li></ul></section><section class="role-section1" id="DesM"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.2</span>. </span>Making a Simulation Design Model</h2><p>When making a simulation design based on the conceptual model of the system under investigation, wee need to abstract away from many items of the conceptual model for obtaining a sufficiently simple design. The right degree of abstraction depends on the purpose of the model. But abstracting away from too many things may make a model too unnatural and not sufficiently generic, implying that it cannot be easily extended to model additional features (such as more than one service desk).</p><p>In our example, the purpose of the simulation model is to compute the <em>maximum queue length</em> and possibly also the <em>service utilization</em>. So, we may abstract away from the following object types:</p><ul><li><em>customers</em>: we don't need any information about individual customers.</li><li><em>waiting lines</em>: we don't need to know who is next, it's sufficient to know the length of the queue.</li><li><em>service clerks</em>: we don't need any information about the service clerk(s).</li></ul><p>Notice that, for simplicity, we consider the customer that is currently being served to be part of the queue. In this way, in the simulation program, we can check if the service desk is busy by testing if the length of the queue is greater than 0. In fact, for being able to compute the service utilization and the maximum queue length, the queue length is the only relevant state variable.</p><p>State variables can be modeled in the simple form of <em>global variables</em> or in the form of <em>attributes</em> of suitable object types. Consequently, the simplest model we can make for the given problem, called <em>Service-Desk-0</em>, has only one global variable: <i>queueLength</i>. But, as an alternative, more explicit, model, called <em>Service-Desk-1</em>, we will also model the system state in terms of (one or more) <i>ServiceDesk</i> objects having only one property: <i>queueLength</i>. As opposed to the simpler model defining <i>queueLength</i> as a global variable, this model allows defining simulation scenarios with two or more service desks operating simultaneously.</p><p>We also look for opportunities to simplify our event model by dropping event types that are not needed, e.g., because their events temporally coincide with events of another type. This is the case with <em>service terminations</em> and <i>customer departure</i> events. Consequently, we can drop the event type <em>service terminations</em>.</p><p>There are two situations when a new service can be started: either when the waiting line is empty and a new customer arrives, or when the waiting line is not empty and a service terminates. Therefore, any <em>service start</em> event immediately follows either a <i>customer arrival</i> or a <i>customer departure</i> event, and we may abstract away from <em>service start</em> events and drop the corresponding event type from the design model.</p><p>So we only need to consider <i>customer arrival</i> and <i>customer departure</i> events, modeled with the two event types <i>Arrival</i> and <i>Departure</i>.</p><p>The event type <i>Arrival</i> is an example of a type of <b>exogenous</b> events,<a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__5"></a> which are not caused by any causal regularity of the system under investigation and, therefore, have to be modeled with a <b>recurrence</b><a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__6"></a> function that allows to compute the time of the next occurrence of an event of that type. In OES, exogenous event types are a built-in concept such that an OES simulator takes care of creating the next exogenous event whenever an event of that type is processed. This mechanism makes sure that there is a continuous stream of exogenous events throughout a simulation run.</p><p>We also have to model the random variations of two variables: (1) the recurrence of (that is, the time in-between two) customer arrival events and (2) the service duration. In a class model, such random variables<a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__7"></a> can be defined as special class-level (&quot;static&quot;) operations, with a stereotype «rv», in the class to which they belong, as shown in the diagrams below.</p><p>We model the recurrence of customer arrival events as a discrete random variable with a uniform distribution between 1 and 6 minutes, which we express in the class diagram of the information design model by appending the symbolic expression <i>U{1-6}</i> within curly braces to the operation declaration, following the UML syntax for property/method modifiers.</p><p>We model the <i>service time</i> random variable with an empirical distribution of 2 minutes with probability 0.3, 3 minutes with probability 0.5 and 4 minutes with probability 0.2, using the symbolic expression <i>Freq{ 2:0.3, 3:0.5, 4:0.2}</i>.</p><p>Computationally, object types and event types correspond to classes, either of an object-oriented information model, such as a UML class diagram, or of a computer program written in an object-oriented programming language, such as Java or JavaScript.</p><section><h4>1.2.1. Service-Desk-0: Modeling <i>queueLength</i> as a global variable</h4><p>As discussed above, the simplest model for the service desk problem with maximum queue length statistics (available in the Sim4edu library as <a href="https://sim4edu.com/sims/14" target="_top">Service-Desk-0</a>) has only one global variable: <i>queueLength</i>, which is a non-negative integer, and a global function for computing the random service time, but no object type.</p><p>An information model for Service-Desk-0 consists of a special class for defining model variables and functions, and two classes for defining the event types <i>Arrival</i> and <i>Departure</i>, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#DesM__figServiceDesk0"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span>. </span>An information design model for Service-Desk-0</a>.</p><figure id="DesM__figServiceDesk0"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span>. </span>An information design model for Service-Desk-0</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/IDM0.svg" width="360" /></div></figure><p>In addition to an information design model for defining the simulation system's state structure, we also need to make a process design model for defining the dynamics of the simulation system. The dynamics of a system consists of events triggering state changes and follow-up events. A process model can be expressed with the help of event rules, which define what happens when an event (of a certain type) occurs, or, more specifically, which state changes and which follow-up events are caused by an event of that type.</p><p>Event rules can be expressed with the help of a process model diagram or in pseudo-code, or in a simulation or programming language. The following <em>Event Graph</em> provides a process design model for the Service-Desk-0 simulation scenario. Circles represent events (or, more precisely, event types) and arrows, which may be annotated with a delay expression, such as +serviceTime(), represent event scheduling relationships. An arrow with a mini-diamond at its source end represents a conditional event scheduling relationship where the condition is expressed in brackets below or above the arrow.</p><figure id="DesM__lof__2"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-2</span>. </span>A process design model in the form of an Event Graph, where the state variable <i>Q</i> stands for <i>queueLength</i></figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/ServiceDesk0_EG.svg" width="360" /></div></figure><p>Event Graphs have originally been proposed by L. Schruben (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358460">1983</a>). Their visual syntax has been improved and harmonized with the business process modeling language <em>BPMN</em> in the <em>Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation (DPMN)</em> proposed by Wagner (<a href="https://articles.jsime.org/1/1/Modeling-for-Simulation-Part-I">2018</a>) and more thoroughly described in the book <a href="https://sim4edu.com/reading/des-engineering/">Discrete Event Simulation Engineering</a>.</p><p>The following table shows the two event rules defined by the above Event Graph, expressed in pseudo-code.</p><table border="1" style="border-spacing:3px;width:100%;"><thead><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>ON (event type)</b></p></td><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>DO (event routine)</b></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Arrival @ t</p></td><td><pre>INCREMENT queueLength

This results in a model with three classes, the object class <i>ServiceDesk</i> with an attribute <i>queueLength</i>, and the event classes <i>Arrival</i> and <i>Departure</i>, both with a reference property <i>serviceDesk</i> for referencing the service desk at which an event occurs. When we also want to compute the service utilization statistics, we need to add an attribute <i>serviceTime</i> to the <i>Departure</i> class for being able to update the service utilization statistics when a customer departs.</p><p>Both event types, <i>Arrival</i> and <i>Departure</i>, now have a many-to-one association with the object type <i>ServiceDesk</i>. This expresses the fact that any such event occurs at a particular service desk, which participates in the event. This association is implemented in the form of a reference property <i>serviceDesk</i> in each of the two event types, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#DesM__figServiceDesk1"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-3</span>. </span>An information design model for Service-Desk-1</a>.</p><figure id="DesM__figServiceDesk1"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-3</span>. </span>An information design model for Service-Desk-1</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/IDM1.svg" width="400" /></div></figure><p>In addition to an information model, we need to make a process model, which captures the dynamics of the service desk system consisting of arrival and departure events triggering state changes and follow-up events.

When a simulation model is based on discrete time, <i>nextMomentDeltaT</i> is set to 1, referring to the next time point.

It samples integers between 2 and 4 from the empirical probability distribution <i>Frequency{ 2:0.3, 3:0.5, 4:0.2}</i>.

Event Types</h4><p>In OES, there is a distinction between two kinds of events:</p><ol><li>events that are <em>caused</em> by other event occurrences during a simulation run;</li><li><em>exogenous</em> events that seem to happen spontaneously, but may be caused by factors, which are external to the simulation model.</li></ol><p>Here is an example of an exogenous event type definition in OESjs-Core1:</p><pre>class <b>CustomerArrival</b> extends eVENT {
  constructor({ occTime, serviceDesk}) {
    super( occTime);
    this.<b>serviceDesk</b> = serviceDesk;
  }
  <b>onEvent</b>() {
    ...
  }
  ...
}</pre><p>The definition of the <i>CustomerArrival</i> event type includes a reference property <i>serviceDesk</i>, which is used for referencing the service desk object at which a customer arrival event occurs. In OESjs, event types are defined as subtypes of the pre-defined class <code>eVENT</code>, from which they inherit an attribute <code>occTime</code>, which holds the occurrence time<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__8"></a> of an event. As opposed to objects, events do normally not have an ID, nor a name. </p><p>Each event type needs to define an <code>onEvent</code> method that implements the event rule for events of the defined type. Event rules are discussed below. </p><p>Exogenous events occur periodically. They are therefore defined with a <em>recurrence</em> function,<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__9"></a> which provides the time in-between two events (often in the form of a random variable). The recurrence function is defined as a class-level (&quot;static&quot;) method:</p><pre>class CustomerArrival extends eVENT {
  ...
  static <b>recurrence</b>() {
    return math.getUniformRandomInteger( 1, 6);
  }
}</pre><p>Notice that the <i>recurrence</i> function of <i>CustomerArrival</i> is coded with the library method <code class="code">math.getUniformRandomInteger</code>, which allows sampling from discrete uniform probability distribution functions. </p><p>In the case of an exogenous event type definition, a <i>createNextEvent</i> method has to be defined for assigning event properties and returning the next event of that type, which is scheduled by invoking the <i>recurrence</i> function for setting its <i>ocurrenceTime</i> and by copying all participant references (such as the <i>serviceDesk</i> reference). </p><pre>class <b>CustomerArrival</b> extends eVENT {
  ...
  <b>createNextEvent</b>() {
    return new CustomerArrival({
      occTime: this.occTime + CustomerArrival.<b>recurrence</b>(),
      serviceDesk: this.serviceDesk
    });
  }
  static <b>recurrence</b>() {...}
}</pre><p>When an OE simulator processes an exogenous event <i>e</i> of type <i>E</i>, it automatically schedules the next event of type <i>E</i> by invoking the <i>createNextEvent</i> method on <i>e</i>, if it is defined, or, otherwise by duplicating <i>e</i> and resetting its occurrence time by invoking <i>E</i>.recurrence().</p><p>For an exogenous event type, it is an option to define a maximum number of event occurrences by setting the static attribute <code>maxNmrOfEvents</code>, as in the following example:</p><pre>CustomerArrival.<b>maxNmrOfEvents</b> = 3;</pre><p>The second event type of the <i>Service-Desk-1</i> model, <i>Departure</i>, is an example of a type of <i>caused</i> events:</p><pre>class <b>CustomerDeparture</b> extends eVENT {
  constructor({ occTime, serviceDesk}) {
    super( occTime);
    this.serviceDesk = serviceDesk;
  }
  onEvent() {
    ...
  }
}</pre><p>A caused event type does neither define a <i>recurrence</i> function nor a <i>createNextEvent</i> method.</p></section><section><h4>2.2.4. Event Rules</h4><p>An event rule<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__a"></a> for an event type defines what happens when an event of that type occurs, by specifying the caused state changes and follow-up events. In OESjs, event rules are coded as <code>onEvent</code> methods of the class that implements the event type. These methods return a set of events (more precisely, a set of JS objects representing events).</p><p>Notice that in the DES literature, event rule methods are called <i>event routines</i><a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__b"></a>.</p><p>For instance, in the <code>CustomerArrival</code> class, the following event rule method is defined:</p><pre>class <b>CustomerArrival</b> extends eVENT {
  ...
  <b>onEvent</b>() {
    var followupEvents=[];
    // increment queue length due to newly arrived customer
    this.serviceDesk.<b>queueLength</b>++;
    // update statistics
    sim.stat.<b>arrivedCustomers</b>++;
    if (this.serviceDesk.queueLength &gt; sim.stat.maxQueueLength) {
      sim.stat.<b>maxQueueLength</b> = this.serviceDesk.queueLength;
    }
    // if the service desk is not busy
    if (this.serviceDesk.queueLength === 1) {
      followupEvents.push( <b>new CustomerDeparture</b>({
        occTime: this.occTime + ServiceDesk.serviceTime(),
        serviceDesk: this.serviceDesk
      }));
    }
    return followupEvents;
  }
}</pre><p>The context of this event rule method is the event that triggers the rule, that is, the variable <code>this</code> references a JS object that represents the triggering event. Thus, the expression <code>this.serviceDesk</code> refers to the service desk object associated with the current customer arrival event, and the statement <code>this.serviceDesk.queueLength++</code> increments the <i>queueLength</i> attribute of this service desk object (as an immediate state change).</p><p>The following event rule method is defined in the <code>CustomerDeparture</code> class. </p><pre>class <b>CustomerDeparture</b> extends eVENT {
  ...
  <b>onEvent</b>() {
    var followupEvents=[];
    // decrement queue length due to departure
    this.serviceDesk.<b>queueLength</b>--;
    // update statistics
    sim.stat.<b>departedCustomers</b>++;
    // if there are still customers waiting
    if (this.serviceDesk.queueLength &gt; 0) {
      // start next service and schedule its end/departure
      followupEvents.push( <b>new CustomerDeparture</b>({
        occTime: this.occTime + ServiceDesk.serviceTime(),
        serviceDesk: this.serviceDesk
      }));
    }
    return followupEvents;
  }
}</pre></section><section><h4>2.2.5. Event Priorities</h4><p>An OES model may imply the possibility of several events occurring at the same time. Consequently, a simulator (like OESjs) must be able to process simultaneous events.<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__c"></a> In particular, simulation models based on discrete time may create simulation states where two or more events occur at the same time, but the model's logic requires them to be processed in a certain order. Defining priorities for events of a certain type helps to control the processing order of simultaneous events.</p><p>Consider an example model based on discrete time with three exogenous event types <i>StartOfMonth</i>, <i>EachDay</i> and <i>EndOfMonth</i>, where the recurrence of StartOfMonth and EndOfMonth is 21, and the recurrence of EachDay is 1. In this example we want to control that on simulation time 1 + <i>i</i> * 21 both a StartOfMonth and an EachDay event occur simultaneously, but StartOfMonth should be processed before EachDay, and on simulation time 21 + <i>i</i> * 21 both an EndOfMonth and an EachDay event occur simultaneously, but EndOfMonth should be processed after EachDay. This can be achieved by defining a high priority, say 2, to StartOfMonth, a middle priority, say 1, to StartOfMonth, and a low priority, say 0, to EndOfMonth. </p><p>Event priorities are defined as class-level properties of event classes in the event type definition file. Thus, we would define in <kbd>StartOfMonth.js</kbd>:</p><pre>StartOfMonth.priority = 2;</pre><p>and in <kbd>EachDay.js</kbd>:</p><pre>EachDay.priority = 1;</pre><p>and finally in <kbd>EndOfMonth.js</kbd>:</p><pre>EndOfMonth.priority = 0;</pre></section><section><h4>2.2.6.

sim.model.statistics = {...};</pre><p>We briefly discuss each group of scenario information items in the following sub-sections.</p><section><h4>2.3.1. Model Parameters</h4><p>While model variables are state variables whose values are changed as an effect of an event occurrence, <em>model parameters</em> are not part of the dynamic state of the simulated system, but are rather used for providing values that can only be read during a simulation run. The main purpose of model parameters is to allow <em>parameter variation experiments</em>.</p></section><section><h4>2.3.2. Simulation Scenario Parameters</h4><p>A few simulation parameters are predefined as attributes of the simulation scenario. The most important ones are:</p><ul><li><i>durationInSimTime</i> - this attribute allows defining the duration of a simulation run; which runs forever when this attribute s not set;</li><li><i>randomSeed</i>: Setting this optional parameter to a positive integer allows to obtain a specific fixed random number sequence (generated by a random number generator). This can be used for performing simulation runs with the same (repeated) random number sequence, e.g., for testing a simulation model by checking if expected results are obtained.</li></ul></section><section id="SimScenarios__sectInitialState"><h4>2.3.3. Initial State</h4><p>Defining an initial state means:</p><ol><li>assigning initial values to global model variables, if there are any;</li><li>defining which objects exist initially, and assigning initial values to their properties;</li><li>defining which events are scheduled initially.</li></ol><p>A <code>setupInitialState</code> procedure takes care of these initial state definitions. A global model variable is initialized in the following way: </p><pre>sim.scenario.setupInitialState = function () {
  // <b>Initialize model variables</b>
  <b>sim.model.v.queueLength</b> = 0;
  // Create initial objects
  ...
  // Schedule initial events
  ...
};</pre><p>An initial state object is created by instantiating an object type of the simulation model with suitable initial property values, as shown in the following example:</p><pre>sim.scenario.setupInitialState = function () {
  // Initialize model variables
  ...
  // <b>Create initial objects</b>
  let <b>serviceDesk1</b> = new ServiceDesk({id: 1, queueLength: 0});
  // Schedule initial events
  ...
};</pre><p>Notice that object IDs are positive integers, but when used as keys in the map <code>sim.objects</code>, they are converted to strings.</p><p>Instead of assigning a <strong>fixed value</strong> to a property like <code>queueLength</code> for defining an object's initial state, as in <code>queueLength: 0</code>, we can also assign it a <strong>fixed expression</strong>, as in <code>queueLength: Math.round(12/30)</code>.</p><p>An <strong>initial event</strong> is scheduled by adding it to the <em>Future Events List (FEL)</em>, as shown in the following example:</p><pre>sim.scenario.setupInitialState = function () {
  // Initialize model variables
  ...
  // Create initial objects
  let desk1 = new ServiceDesk({id: 1, queueLength: 0});
  // <b>Schedule initial events</b>
  sim.<b>FEL.add</b>( <b>new CustomerArrival</b>({occTime:1, serviceDesk: desk1}));
};</pre><p>Initial objects or events can be parametrized with the help of model parameters.</p></section><section><h4>2.3.4. Defining Alternative Scenarios with Different Initial States</h4><p>For running a model on top of different initial states, one can define a list of scenarios, each with its own <code>setupInitialState</code> procedure: </p><pre>sim.<b>scenarios[1]</b> = {
  scenarioNo: 1,
  title: &quot;Scenario with two service desks&quot;,
  setupInitialState: function () {
    // Create initial objects
    var sD1 = new ServiceDesk({id: 1, queueLength: 0}),
        sD2 = new ServiceDesk({id: 2, queueLength: 0});
    // Schedule initial events
    sim.FEL.add( new CustomerArrival({occTime: 1, serviceDesk: sD1}));
    sim.FEL.add( new CustomerArrival({occTime: 2, serviceDesk: sD2}));
  }
};
sim.<b>scenarios[2]</b> = {...}</pre><p>Before running a simulation, a specific scenario can be chosen in the user interface.</p><blockquote class="role-warning"><p>Do not set model parameters in the <code>setupInitialState</code> procedure! This would interfere with parameter variation experiments in which the same parameter(s) are used.</p></blockquote></section></section><section class="role-section1" id="SimStatistics"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.4</span>. </span>Statistics</h2><p>In scientific and engineering simulation projects the main goal is getting estimates of the values of certain variables or performance indicators with the help of statistical methods. In educational simulations, statistics can be used for observing simulation runs and for learning the dynamics of a simulation model. </p><p>For collecting statistics, suitable <em>statistics variables</em> have to be defined, as in the following example:</p><pre>sim.model.<b>setupStatistics</b> = function () {
  sim.stat.arrivedCustomers = 0;
  sim.stat.departedCustomers = 0;
  sim.stat.maxQueueLength = 0;
};</pre><p>Statistics variables have to be updated in <i>onEvent</i> methods. For instance, the variables <i>arrivedCustomers</i> and <i>maxQueueLength</i> are updated in the onEvent method of the <i>CustomerArrival</i> event class:</p><pre>class CustomerArrival extends eVENT {
  ...
  onEvent() {
    ...
    // update statistics
    sim.stat.<b>arrivedCustomers</b>++;
    if (this.serviceDesk.queueLength &gt; sim.stat.maxQueueLength) {
      sim.stat.<b>maxQueueLength</b> = this.serviceDesk.queueLength;
    }
    ...
  }
}</pre><p>In certain cases, a statistics variable can only be computed at the end of a simulation run. For this purpose, there is the option to define a <i>computeFinalStatistics</i> procedure:</p><pre>sim.model.<b>computeFinalStatistics</b> = function () {
  // percentage of business days without stock-outs
  sim.stat.serviceLevel = (sim.time - sim.stat.nmrOfStockOuts) / sim.time * 100;
};</pre><p>After running a simulation scenario, the statistics results are shown in a table:</p><table border="1" id="SimStatistics__lot__2"><caption><span class="role-label">Table <span class="role-number">2-2</span>. </span>Statistics</caption><tbody><tr><td>arrivedCustomers</td><td>289</td></tr><tr><td>departedCustomers</td><td>288</td></tr><tr><td>maxQueueLength</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section class="role-section1" id="SimExperiments"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.5</span>. </span>Simulation Experiments</h2><p>There are different types of simulation experiments. In a <em>simple experiment</em>, a simulation scenario is run repeatedly by defining a number of replications (iterations) for being able to compute average statistics.</p><p>In a <em>parameter variation experiment</em>, several variants of a simulation scenario (called <em>experiment scenarios</em>), are defined by defining value sets for certain <em>model parameters</em> (the <em>experiment parameters</em>), such that a parameter variation experiment run consists of a set of experiment scenario runs, one for each combination of parameter values.</p><p>An experiment type is defined for a given simulation model and an experiment of that type is run on top of a given simulation scenario for that model.</p><p>When running an experiment, the resulting statistics data are stored in a database, which allows looking them up later on or exporting them to data analysis tools (such as Microsoft Excel and RStudio)</p><section><h4>2.6.1. Simple Experiments</h4><p>A simple experiment type is defined with a <code>sim.experimentType</code> record on top of a model by defining (1) the number of <em>replications</em> and (2) possibly a list of <em>seed values</em>, one for each replication.
