 <section id="shortDescription">
  <p>A shop is selling one product type only (e.g., one model of TVs), such that its in-house inventory only consists of items of that type. 
   On each business day, customers come to the shop and place their orders. If the ordered product quantity is in stock, the customer pays 
   for the order and the ordered items are provided. Otherwise, the shop has missed a business opportunity and the difference between order quantity 
   and the inventory level counts as a lost sale. The order may still be partially fulfilled, if there are still some items in stock, 
   else the customer has to leave the shop without any item. The percentage of lost sales is an important performance indicator.</p>
  <p>Whenever the stock level falls below a certain threshold (called <i>reorder point</i>), the shop places a replenishment order 
   with a quantity computed as the difference between an upper threshold (called <i>target inventory</i>) and the current stock level.</p>
  </section>
  
 <details><summary>Background</summary>
  <p>Inventory management is one of the big topics in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research">Operations Research</a>,
   which is a scientific discipline that develops mathematical/analytical methods for decision-making in various application domains. </p>
  <p>The goal of inventory management is to satisfy demand and avoid <em>stock-out</em> events, while minimizing inventory costs. 
   Too much inventory incurs unnecessary holding costs (and capital costs). Not having enough inventory results in stock-outs, 
   impacting the ability to manufacture goods or provide customers with products.</p>
  <p>In fact, stock-outs may result in loss of:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Revenue</li>
    <li>Gross profit</li>
    <li>Customers</li>
    <li>Market share</li>
   </ul>
<p>There are two different replenishment policies used in inventory management:</p>
<ol>
 <li>The <em><b>continuous</b> replenishment</em> policy is based on a <em>reorder point</em>, such that a new replenishment order 
  is issued whenever the stock level falls below the reorder point.</li>
 <li>The <em><b>periodic</b> replenishment</em> policy is based on a <em>reorder interval</em>, such that new replenishment orders 
  are periodically issued whenever the reorder interval time has passed.</li>
</ol>
<p>For achieving a certain service level, the reorder point has to be set accordingly. A common approach for setting 
 the reorder point (RP) is based on the concept of <em>safety stock (SS)</em>, which is extra inventory beyond the 
 <em>expected lead time demand ELTD</em> (the expected daily demand multiplied by the expected lead time in days):</p>
<p>RP = ELTD + SS, with ELTD = E(D) &lowast; E(LT)</p>
<p>Now the question is how to compute the safety stock (on the assumption that both lead time and demand vary independently)?</p>
<p>A simple approach (the <em>“max – average” method</em>) is to deduct the expected lead time demand from the <em>maximum lead time demand MLT</em>D:</p>

<div>SS = MLTD - ELTD, with MLTD = E(D) &lowast; max(LT),</div>
<div>which implies that RP = MLTD.</div>
<p>However, this simple approach does not allow taking a target service level into account.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated method is based on a target service level:</p>
<p>SS = Z &lowast; Sqrt( E(LT) &lowast; Var(D) + E(D)<sup>2</sup> &lowast; Var(LT))</p>
<p>Here, <em>Sqrt()</em> stands for the square root operation, <em>Var()</em> for the statistical variance (being the square of the standard deviation), and <em>Z</em> represents&nbsp;the "Z-score", which&nbsp;allows taking&nbsp;a target service level into
    account. The following table allows determining the Z-score from the target service level.</p>
<table border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">Target service level</th>
            <td>90%</td>
            <td>91%</td>
            <td>92%</td>
            <td>93%</td>

            <td>96%</td>
            <td>97%</td>
            <td>98%</td>
            <td>99%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">Z-Score</th>
            <td>1.28</td>
            <td>1.34</td>
            <td>1.41</td>
            <td>1.48</td>
            <td>1.55</td>
            <td>1.64</td>
            <td>1.75</td>
            <td>1.88</td>

            <td>2.33</td>
        </tr>

<p>Typically, a target service level of 95%, and hence a&nbsp;Z-score of 1.64, is used, but the choice may depend on the type of product.</p>

  <p>For simplicity, customer orders are treated in an abstract way by aggregating all customer orders during a business day 
   into a daily demand event, such that the random variation of the daily order quantity is modeled by a random variable.</p>
  <p>Likewise, the random variation of the <em>delivery lead time</em>, which is the time in-between a replenishment order 
   and the corresponding delivery, is modeled by a random variable.</p>  
  <details><summary>Information Design Model</summary>
     <p>The random variation of the lead time between a replenishment order and the corresponding delivery
       is modeled by a random variable with a uniform probability distribution between 1 and 3 days.
       The inventory is modelled as an object with three attributes: <code>productQuantityInStock</code>,
       <code>reorderPoint</code> and <code>targetInventory</code>. For simplicity, the model does not create
       replenishment order events, but instead it only schedules corresponding delivery events.</p>
      <p>Consequently, we model just one object type: <b><code>SingleProductShop</code></b>, with three attributes
         <code>quantityInStock</code> (NonNegativeInteger),  <code>reorderPoint</code> (NonNegativeInteger), 
		 and <code>targetInventory</code> (PositiveInteger). In addition, we model two event types:</p>
     <ul>
       <li><b><code>DailyDemand</code></b> as an exogeneous event type with one attribute: <code>quantity</code> (PositiveInteger),
         and with the random variable function <code>sampleQuantity</code> and, as an exogeneous event type, 
		 with a <code>recurrence</code> function.</li>
       <li><b><code>Delivery</code></b> as a caused event type with one attribute: <code>quantity</code> (PositiveInteger),
         and with the random variable function <code>sampleLeadTime</code>.</li>
     </ul>

	 <p>When the design model is implemented with an object-oriented programming language or framework, 
	  the participation associations between <code>DailyDemand</code> and <code>SingleProductShop</code>, as well as 
	  between <code>Delivery</code> and <code>SingleProductShop</code>,	are represented with the corresponding
    reference properties <code>shop</code> and <code>receiver</code>. This is also the case when using the Object Event
	  Simulation (OES) framework <i>OESjs</i> available from <a href="https://sim4edu.com">Sim4edu</a>, 
	  where all object types are derived from the pre-defined OES category <code>oBJECT</code> 
	  and all event types are derived from the pre-defined OES category <code>eVENT</code>, 
	  as shown in the following diagram:</p>
