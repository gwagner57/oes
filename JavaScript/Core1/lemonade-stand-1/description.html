 <section id="shortDescription">
  <p>A lemonade seller makes lemonade in pitchers and sells it in paper cups at a stand in a street.
   Each day consists of the following process steps and phases:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>The day starts with making planning decisions (demand forecasting and production planning)
    and purchasing the required input materials (lemons, sugar, etc.).</li>
   <li>Some time later, the ordered input materials are delivered, the planned quantity of lemonade is produced and the stand is opened.</li>
   <li>Then, customers arrive randomly and order a cup of lemonade. As long as there is still lemonade in stock, customer orders are served.</li>
   <li>At the end of the day, the lemonade stand is closed and the remaining lemonade and expired input items are dumped.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A lemonade stand can be modeled in a generic way as an instance of a <em>single product manufacturing company</em> 
    that uses an input inventory and transforms <em>input items</em> into an <em>output item</em> (the product). We make a series of three 
    increasingly complex models of lemonade stands:</p>
   <ol><li>In the basic model, we build a scenario with just one lemonade stand (a monopoly) and we abstract away from market conditions,
    customers and individual customer orders as well as from suppliers, individual replenishment orders and corresponding deliveries, 
	inventory management, marketing activities and competition. Customer orders are aggregated into a random daily demand quantity. 
	An aggregate replenishment order is directly converted into a corresponding daily delivery. Due to just-in-time deliveries
	there is no need for inventory management.</li>
    <li>In the second model, <a href='../../core4b/lemonade-stand-2/'>Lemonade-Stand-2</a>, we consider individual (possibly delayed) deliveries, 
	 inventory management and market conditions dominated by the weather.</li>
    <li>In the third model, we consider individual customers and we build a scenario with several lemonade stands that compete with each other.</li>
   </ol>

 <details><summary>Background</summary>
  <p>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_Stand'>Lemonade Stand Game</a> was developed in 1973 by Bob Jamison for mainframe
   computers and was later ported to the Apple II platform in 1979 and distributed by Apple throughout the 1980s.</p>
  <p>The Lemonade Stand model allows simulation-based active learning of the following topics:</p>
     <ol>
      <li><details id="PED"><summary>Price Elasticity of Demand</summary>
       <p>The <em>Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)</em> is a measure used to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded
         of a good or service to a change in its price. More precisely, it gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to
         a one percent change in price (ceteris paribus, i.e. holding constant all the other determinants of demand, such as income).
         In general, the demand for a good is said to be inelastic when the PED is less than one (in absolute value): that is,
         changes in price have a relatively small effect on the quantity of the good demanded. The demand for a good is said to be
         elastic when its PED is greater than one (in absolute value): that is, changes in price have a relatively large effect
         on the demand quantity of a good.</p>
        </details></li>
       <li><details><summary>Sales Price Planning</summary>
         <p>Normally, price planning is based on full costs per product unit, which are computed as fixed costs (mainly labor, and, e.g., depreciation
             on assets and marketing costs) plus variable costs (mainly input materials). In <em>cost-plus pricing</em>, the product price <i>p</i> is planned by adding
             a proportional profit to the costs <i>c</i>: <i>p</i> = <i>c</i> + <i>rc</i>  where <i>r</i> is the planned profit rate.</p>
         <p>During favorable market conditions, full costs could be used for cost-plus pricing, while during periods of poor sales (e.g., due to increased competition),
             marginal costs may be used. The profit rate could be adapted when the <a href="#PED" title="Price Elasticity of Demand">PED</a> of the product is changing.
             For instance, the lemonade stand could increase its planned profit rate when the weather conditions are sunny and warm, because under such conditions
             the otherwise very price-elastic demand for lemonade gets more inelastic, thus allowing for price increases without affecting the demand.</p>
        </details></li>
       <li><details><summary>Demand Forecasting</summary>
         <p>The demand of a new day can be forecasted on the basis of the previously recorded daily demand data, which forms a <em>time series</em>.
             The two most common forecasting methods for time series are the <em>Simple Moving Average</em> and the <em>Exponentially Weighted Moving Average</em>
             methods. See https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411avg.htm. In the LemonadeStand-1 model, the Simple Moving Average method is used.</p>
        </details></li>
       <li><details><summary>Bill of Materials</summary>
           <p>A <em>Bill of Materials (BoM)</em> defines the composition of a product in the form of a list of component items, each with a quantity,
               as required for assembling a production unit. In general, a component item may also have a BoM, i.e. be composed of other items, such that a nested
               composition tree is obatined.</p>
           <p>In the case of a lemonade stand with lemonade as a product, the production unit may be a 3.5 ltr pitcher of lemonade, so we may have the following BoM:</p>
           <pre>{"Lemon": 3, "Water": 2.5, "IceCubes": 20, "Sugar": 0.3}</pre>
        </details></li>
       <li><details><summary>Production Planning</summary>
         <p>The production quantity (in number of batches) is planned according to the demand forecast, but under the constraints of using the available input items in stock
             and the budget available for purchasing additional inpute items.</p>

 <details><summary>Simulation Design</summary>
  <p>Following the <a href="https://articles.jsime.org/1/1"><em>Object Event Modeling and Simulation (OEM&amp;S)</em></a> paradigm, we first model
   the system's object types (defining its state structure) together with its event types in an <em>information model</em>,
   and then the system's dynamics in the form of event rules in a <em>process model</em>.</p>
  <details><summary>Information Design Model</summary>
     <p>The basic version of the LSG model contains the following object types:</p>
     <ol>
       <li><i>SingleProductCompany</i></li>
       <li><i>InputItemType</i> as a subtype of <i>ItemType</i></li>
       <li><i>OutputItemType</i> as a subtype of <i>ItemType</i></li>
     </ol>
       <p>and the following event types:</p>
       <ol>
           <li>StartOfDay</li>
           <li>DailyDelivery</li>
           <li>DailyDemand</li>
           <li>EndOfDay</li>
       </ol>

     <p>Notice that the component types <code>InputItemType</code> and <code>BomItemPerBatch</code> can be implemented in the form of
       the map-valued properties <code>inputItemTypes</code> and <code>bomItemsPerBatch</code> holding values like</p>
     <pre>{"Lemon": 3, "Water": 2.5, "IceCubes": 50, "Sugar": 0.3, "PaperCup": 1}</pre>
     <p>These special properties, and the behavior operations of <i>SingleProductCompany</i> instances are described in the following diagram:</p>

  <details><summary>Implementation with OESjs</summary>
   <p>The JavaScript-based simulator OESjs implements the Object Event Simulation paradigm, and, consequently, allows a
  straight-forward coding of OEM class models and DPMN process models. You can inspect the model's 
  <a href="https://sim4edu.com/oesjs/core1/lemonade-stand-1">OESjs code</a> on the OES GitHub repo.</p>
  <details><summary>Implementing the Information Design Model</summary>
    <p>For implementing the information design model, we have to code all object types, event types and activity types specified in the model
     in the form of classes.</p>
