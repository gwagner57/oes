However, the jumper and the speaker do not speak the same language, so both agents first have to learn which signal communicates which jump length.

<p>In this simulation of a signaling reinforcement learning (RL) process, two agents learn to communicate
 with each other via signals. One of the two agents (the blind "jumper") is not able to see the size of a barrier
 over which he has to jump, while the other agent (the "speaker") is able to see the size of the barrier
 and tries to communicate the jump length to the jumper. However, the two agents do not speak a common language,
 so both agents first have to learn which signal communicates which jump length. Both of them can perceive the
 success or failure of a jump (a jump fails if it is too short or too long), and then update their signalling,
 resp. signal interpretation, function, accordingly.</p>

<p>This RL process model is described by the DPMN process diagram to the right.
 There are two RL agents: a <i>Speaker</i> and a (blind) <i>Jumper</i>. Each RL round begins with a <i>StartOver</i> event,
 which triggers a <i>PerceiveBarrier</i> perception event at the <i>Speaker</i>, which causes the <i>Speaker</i>
 to create a <i>SendJumpLengthSignal</i> message event leading to an invocation of the jumper's <i>receive</i> method,
 which creates a <i>Jump</i> action event.</p>
