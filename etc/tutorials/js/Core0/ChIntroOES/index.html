    <title>Creating Object Event Simulations with OESjs-Core0</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>The JavaScript-based simulation framework <i>OESjs</i> implements
  the <i>Object Event Simulation (<a href="https://sim4edu.com/OES"
  target="_top">OES</a>)</i> paradigm, representing a general <i>Discrete
  Event Simulation</i> approach based on <i>object-oriented</i> modeling and
  <i>event scheduling</i>. In OES, a model normally defines various types of
  objects and events, but OES also supports</p><ol>
      <li><p>models without objects, if they define state variables in the
      form of global <i>model variables</i>, instead;</p></li>

      <li><p>models without events, if they use pure fixed-increment time
      progression (by defining an <code>onEachTimeStep</code> procedure and a
      <code>timeIncrement</code> parameter), instead; such a model can be used
      </p><ol type="a">
          <li><p>as a discrete model that abstracts away from explicit events
          and uses only implicit time events ("ticks"), which is a popular
          approach in social science simulation, or</p></li>

          <li><p>for modeling continuous state changes (e.g., objects moving
          in a continuous space).</p></li>
        </ol></li>
    </ol><p>OESjs supports two forms of simulations:</p><ol>
      <li><p>Standalone scenario simulations, which are good for getting a
      quick impression of a simulation model, e.g., by checking some simple
      statistics or by observing visualized (or sonified) simulation
      runs.</p></li>

      <li><p>Simulation experiments, which are defined as a set of simulation
      scenarios by defining value sets for certain model variables, such that
      an experiment run consists of a set of scenario runs.</p></li>
    </ol><p>Using a simulation framework like OESjs means that only the
  model-specific logic has to be coded (in the form of object types, event
  types, event routines and other functions for model-specific computations),
  but not the general simulator operations (e.g., time progression and
  statistics) and the environment handling (e.g., user interfaces for
  statistics output and visualization).</p><p>The following sections present
  the basic concepts of the OESjs simulation framework, and show how to
  implement the service desk models described in <a
