    <title>Simulation Time</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>A simulation model has an underlying <b><i>time model</i></b>,
  which can be either <i>discrete time</i>, when setting</p><pre>sim.model.time = "discrete";</pre><p>or
  <i>continuous time</i>, when setting</p><pre>sim.model.time = "continuous";</pre><p>Choosing
  a discrete time model means that time is measured in steps (with equal
  durations), and all temporal random variables used in the model need to be
  discrete (i.e., based on discrete probability distributions). Choosing a
  continuous time model means that one has to define a <i>simulation time
  granularity</i>, as explained in the next sub-section.</p><p>In both cases,
  the underlying simulation <b><i>time unit</i></b> can be either left
  unspecified (e.g., in the case of an abstract time model), or it can be set
  to one of the time units "ms", "s", "m", "h", "D", "W", "M" or "Y", as
  in</p><pre>sim.model.timeUnit = "h";</pre><p>Typical examples of time models
  are:</p><ol>
      <li><p>An abstract discrete model of time where time runs in steps
      without any concrete meaning: </p><pre>sim.model.time = "discrete";</pre></li>

      <li><p>A concrete discrete model of time in number of days: </p><pre>sim.model.time = "discrete";
sim.model.timeUnit = "D";</pre></li>

      <li><p>A concrete continuous model of time in number of seconds:
      </p><pre>sim.model.time = "continuous";
sim.model.timeUnit = "s";</pre></li>
    </ol><section><h4>2.1.1. Time Granularity</h4><p>A model's <em>time
  granularity</em> is the time delay until the next moment, such that the
  model does not allow considering an earlier next moment. This is captured by
  the simulation parameter <i>nextMomentDeltaT</i> used by the simulator for
  scheduling immediate events with a minimal delay. When a simulation model is
  based on discrete time, <i>nextMomentDeltaT</i> is set to 1, referring to
  the next time point. When a simulation model is based on continuous time,
  <i>nextMomentDeltaT</i> is set to the default value 0.001, unless the model
  parameter <code>sim.model.nextMomentDeltaT</code> is explicitly assigned in
  the <kbd>simulation.js</kbd> file.</p></section><section><h4>2.1.2. Time
  Progression</h4><p>An important issue in simulation is the question how the
  simulation time is advanced by the simulator. The OES paradigm supports
  <strong>next-event</strong> time progression and
  <strong>fixed-increment</strong> time progression, as well as their
  combination.</p><p>An OESjs-Core0 model with fixed-increment time
  progression has to define a suitable periodic time event type, like
  <code>EachSecond</code> or <code>EachDay</code> in the form of an exogenous
  event type with a recurrence function returning the value 1. Such a model
  can be used for</p><ol>
      <li>modeling continuous state changes (e.g., objects moving in a
      continuous space), or</li>

      <li>making a discrete model that abstracts away from explicit events and
      uses only implicit periodic time events ("ticks"), which is a popular
      approach in social science simulation.</li>
    </ol><p>Examples of discrete event simulation models with fixed-increment
  time progression and no explicit events are the <a

  href="https://sim4edu.com/sims/25/index.html">Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
  (SIR) Disease Model</a>.</p></section></body>
