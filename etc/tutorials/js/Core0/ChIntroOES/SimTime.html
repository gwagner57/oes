    <title>Simulation Time</title>
  </head>
  <body><p>A simulation model has an underlying <b><i>time model</i></b>, which can be either <i>discrete time</i>, when setting</p><pre>sim.model.time = "discrete";</pre><p>or
  <i>continuous time</i>, when setting</p><pre>sim.model.time = "continuous";</pre><p>Choosing a discrete time model means that time is measured in
  steps (with equal durations), and all temporal random variables used in the model need to be discrete (i.e., based on discrete probability
  distributions). Choosing a continuous time model means that one has to define a <i>simulation time granularity</i>, as explained in the next
  sub-section.</p><p>In both cases, the underlying simulation <b><i>time unit</i></b> can be either left unspecified (e.g., in the case of an abstract
  time model), or it can be set to one of the time units "ms", "s", "m", "h", "D", "W", "M" or "Y", as in</p><pre>sim.model.timeUnit = "h";</pre><p>Typical
  examples of time models are:</p><ol>
      <li><p>An abstract discrete model of time where time runs in steps without any concrete meaning: </p><pre>sim.model.time = "discrete";</pre></li>
      <li><p>A concrete discrete model of time in number of days: </p><pre>sim.model.time = "discrete";
sim.model.timeUnit = "D";</pre></li>
      <li><p>A concrete continuous model of time in number of seconds: </p><pre>sim.model.time = "continuous";
sim.model.timeUnit = "s";</pre></li>
    </ol><section><h4>2.1.1. Time Granularity</h4><p>When a simulation model is based on continuous time, it is possible to control the time
  granularity (the time delay until the next moment) in one of two ways:</p><ol>
      <li>through simulation time rounding by setting the model parameter <i>timeRoundingDecimalPlaces</i> to a suitable value (e.g., to 2 for
      obtaining time values like 281.39), which implies a corresponding value of the model parameter <i>nextMomentDeltaT</i>;</li>
      <li>by explicitly setting the model parameter <i>nextMomentDeltaT</i>.</li>
    </ol><p>The model parameter <i>nextMomentDeltaT</i> is used by the simulator for scheduling next events with a minimal
  delay.</p></section><section><h4>2.1.2. Time Progression</h4><p>An important issue in simulation is the question how the simulation time is advanced
  by the simulator. The OES paradigm supports <strong>fixed-increment</strong> time progression and <strong>next-event</strong> time progression, and
  their combination.</p><p>An OESjs model with pure fixed-increment time progression has to define a <code>sim.model.OnEachTimeStep</code> procedure,
  but no event types. Such a model can be used for</p><ol>
      <li>modeling continuous state changes (e.g., objects moving in a continuous space), or</li>
      <li>making a discrete model that abstracts away from explicit events and uses only implicit periodic time events ("ticks"), which is a popular
      approach in social science simulation.</li>
    </ol><p>By default, in fixed-increment time progression with an <code>OnEachTimeStep</code> procedure, simulation time is incremented by 1. This
  can be changed by setting <code>sim.model.timeIncrement</code> in the <kbd>simulation.js</kbd> file.</p><p>Examples of discrete event simulation
  models with fixed-increment time progression and no explicit events are the <a href="https://sim4edu.com/sims/6">Schelling Segregation Model</a> and
  the <a href="https://sim4edu.com/sims/25/index.html">Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Disease Model</a>.</p><p>A simulation model with pure
  next-event time progression, representing a classical DES model, defines event types and event rules, but no <code>timeIncrement</code>
  parameter.</p><p>It is also possible to combine both time progression mechanisms, e.g., in a "hybrid" model that supports both discrete and
  continuous state changes, or in a social science model based on "ticks" and explicit events.</p></section><section><h4>2.1.3. Real-Time
  Simulation</h4><p>Real-time simulation means to run an observable simulation model in such a way that the speed of its state changes is close to the
  speed of the state changes in the simulated real-world system. This is only possible if the simulator is able to run the simulation at least as fast
  as the real-world system is running. If this is the case, the running simulator can be slowed down to real-time speed. </p><p>Real-time simulation
  requires fixed-increment time progression by setting the model parameter <i>timeIncrement</i>. In the case of a model with a <i>timeUnit</i> and
  real-time simulation turned on (by setting the scenario parameter <i>realtimeFactor</i> to 1), the simulator delays each simulation step such that
  its real duration is equal to its simulation time, which is <i>timeIncrement</i> [timeUnit].</p><p>In the case of a model without a <i>timeUnit</i>
  (that is, with abstract time), the simulator cannot automatically run in real-time, but the scenario parameter <i>stepDuration</i> (for specifying
  the real duration of a simulation step) can be set to a suitable value for making the simulation observable in real-time.</p></section></body>
