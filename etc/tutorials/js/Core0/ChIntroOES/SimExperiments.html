    <title>Simulation Experiments</title>
  </head>
  <body><p>There are different types of simulation experiments. In a <em>simple experiment</em>, a simulation scenario is run repeatedly by defining a
  number of replications (iterations) for being able to compute average statistics.</p><p>In a <em>parameter variation experiment</em>, several
  variants of a simulation scenario (called <em>experiment scenarios</em>), are defined by defining value sets for certain model variables (the
  <em>experiment parameters</em>), such that a parameter variation experiment run consists of a set of experiment scenario runs, one for each
  combination of parameter values.</p><p>When running an experiment, the resulting statistics data are stored in a database, which allows looking them
  up later on or exporting them to data analysis tools (such as Microsoft Excel and RStudio)</p><section><h4>2.6.1. <em>Simple
  Experiments</em></h4><p>A simple experiment is defined with a <code>sim.experiment</code> record on top of a scenario by defining (1) the number of
  <em>replications</em> and (2) possibly a list of <em>seed values</em>, one for each replication. The following code shows an example of a simple
  experiment definition:</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.experiment.<b>replications</b> = 5;
sim.experiment.<b>seeds</b> = [1234, 2345, 3456, 4567, 5678];</pre><p>Running this simple experiment means running the underlying scenario 5 times,
  each time with another random seed, as specified by the list of seeds. The resulting statistics are composed of the statistics for each replication
  complemented with a summary statistics listing averages, standard deviations, min/max values and confidence intervals.</p><p>When no seeds are defined, 
  the experiment is run with implicit random seeds using JavaScript's built-in random
  number generator, which implies that experiment runs are not reproducible.</p></section><section><h4>2.6.2. <em>Parameter Variation
  Experiments</em></h4><p>A parameter variation experiment is defined with (1) a number of <em>replications</em>, (2) a list of <em>seed values</em>
  (one for each replication), and (3) one or more experiment parameters. The following code shows an example of a parameter variation experiment
  definition:</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.experiment.replications = 5;
sim.experiment.seeds = [1234, 2345, 3456, 4567, 5678];
sim.experiment.<b>parameterDefs</b> = [
  {name:"arrivalEventRate", values:[0.4, 0.5, 0.6]}
];</pre><p>Notice that this experiment definition defines three experiment scenarios: the 1st one with a value of 0.4 for the model variable
  <i>arrivalEventRate</i>, the 2nd one with a value of 0.5 and the 3rd one with a value of 0.6. Running this parameter variation experiment means
  running each of the 3 experiment scenarios 5 times (each time with another random seed, as specified by the list of seeds). The resulting
  statistics, as shown in the following table, is computed by averaging all statistics variables defined for the given model. </p><table border="1"

    </table><p>An experiment parameter must have the same name as the model variable to which it refers. It defines a set of values for this model
  variable, either using a <code>values</code> field or a combination of a <code>startValue</code> and <code>endValue</code> field (and
  <code>stepSize</code> for a non-default increment value) as in the following example:</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.experiment.replications = 5;
sim.experiment.seeds = [1234, 2345, 3456, 4567, 5678];
sim.experiment.parameterDefs = [
  {name:"arrivalEventRate", <b>startValue</b>:0.4, <b>endValue</b>:0.6)}
];</pre><p>There are a few further settings for controlling the storage of experiment statistics. An experiment should have an <code>id</code> value
  and a <code>title</code>. In addition, it should have a sequence number relative to the simulation scenario for which it is defined. These settings
  are shown in the following code listing:</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.experiment.id = 1;
sim.experiment.title = "Test";
sim.experiment.experimentNo = 1;  // sequence number relative to simulation scenario</pre></section><section><h4>2.6.1. <em>Storage of Experiment
  Statistics Data</em></h4><p>An experiment's statistics data is stored in a browser-managed database using JavaScript's <em>IndexedDB</em>
  technology. The name of this database is the same as the name of the simulation model. It can be inspected with the help of the browser's developer
  tools, which are typically activated with the key combination [Shift]+[Ctrl]+[I]. For instance, in Google's Chrome browser, one has to go to
  Application/Storage/IndexedDB.</p><p>The experiment statistics database consists of three tables containing data about (1) experiment definitions,
  (2) experiment runs, and (3) experiment scenario runs, which can be exported to a CSV file. By default, the statistics data obtained from running
  all replications of an experiment scenario is stored in averaged form as one experiment scenario run record. </p><section><p>When the output
  statistics of each single experiment scenario run is to be stored (for later analysis), this can be achieved by setting the Boolean experiment
  attribute <code>storeEachExperimentScenarioRun</code> to <i>true</i>, as in</p><pre>sim.experiment.storeEachExperimentScenarioRun = true;</pre><p>When
  time series data is to be created and stored for certain statistics variables, this can be achieved by listing the names of the variables in the
  experiment attribute <code>timeSeriesStatisticsVariables</code>, as in</p><pre>sim.experiment.timeSeriesStatisticsVariables = ["arrivedCustomers","departedCustomers"];</pre></section></section></body>
