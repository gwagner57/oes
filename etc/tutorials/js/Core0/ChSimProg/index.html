    <title>Simulation Programming with OESjs-Core0</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>Using a simulation framework like OESjs means that only the
  model-specific logic has to be coded (in the form of object types, event
  types, event routines and other functions for model-specific computations),
  but not the general simulator operations (e.g., time progression and
  statistics) and the environment handling (e.g., user interfaces for
  statistics output and visualization).</p><p>The following sections present
  important simulation programming issues.</p></body>
