    <title>Making a Simulation Design Model</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>When making a simulation design based on the conceptual model of
  the system under investigation, wee need to abstract away from many items of
  the conceptual model for obtaining a sufficiently simple design. The right
  degree of abstraction depends on the purpose of the model. But abstracting
  away from too many things may make a model too unnatural and not
  sufficiently generic, implying that it cannot be easily extended to model
  additional features (such as more than one service desk).</p><p>In our
  example, the purpose of the simulation model is to compute the <em>maximum
  queue length</em> and possibly also the <em>service utilization</em>. So, we
  may abstract away from the following object types:</p><ul>
      <li><em>customers</em>: we don't need any information about individual
      customers.</li>

      <li><em>waiting lines</em>: we don't need to know who is next, it's
      sufficient to know the length of the queue.</li>

      <li><em>service clerks</em>: we don't need any information about the
      service clerk(s).</li>
    </ul><p>Notice that, for simplicity, we consider the customer that is
  currently being served to be part of the queue. In this way, in the
  simulation program, we can check if the service desk is busy by testing if
  the length of the queue is greater than 0. In fact, for being able to
  compute the service utilization and the maximum queue length, the queue
  length is the only relevant state variable.</p><p>State variables can be
  modeled in the simple form of <em>global variables</em> or in the form of
  <em>attributes</em> of suitable object types. Consequently, the simplest
  model we can make for the given problem, called <em>ServiceDesk-0</em>, has
  only one global variable: <i>queueLength</i>. But, as an alternative, more
  explicit, model, called <em>ServiceDesk-1</em>, we will also model the
  system state in terms of (one or more) <i>ServiceDesk</i> objects having
  only one property: <i>queueLength</i>. As opposed to the simpler model
  defining <i>queueLength</i> as a global variable, this model allows defining
  simulation scenarios with two or more service desks operating
  simultaneously.</p><p>We also look for opportunities to simplify our event
  model by dropping event types that are not needed, e.g., because their
  events temporally coincide with events of another type. This is the case
  with <em>service terminations</em> and <i>customer departure</i> events.
  Consequently, we can drop the event type <em>service
  terminations</em>.</p><p>There are two situations when a new service can be
  started: either when the waiting line is empty and a new customer arrives,
  or when the waiting line is not empty and a service terminates. Therefore,
  any <em>service start</em> event immediately follows either a <i>customer
  arrival</i> or a <i>customer departure</i> event, and we may abstract away
  from <em>service start</em> events and drop the corresponding event type
  from the design model.</p><p>So we only need to consider <i>customer
  arrival</i> and <i>customer departure</i> events, modeled with the two event
  types <i>Arrival</i> and <i>Departure</i>.</p><p>The event type
  <i>Arrival</i> is an example of a type of <b>exogenous</b> events,<a
  class="role-index-term">exogenous event</a> which are not caused by any
  causal regularity of the system under investigation and, therefore, have to
  be modeled with a <b>recurrence</b><a class="role-index-term">recurrence</a>
  function that allows to compute the time of the next occurrence of an event
  of that type. In OES, exogenous event types are a built-in concept such that
  an OES simulator takes care of creating the next exogenous event whenever an
  event of that type is processed. This mechanism makes sure that there is a
  continuous stream of exogenous events throughout a simulation run.</p><p>We
  also have to model the random variations of two variables: (1) the
  recurrence of (that is, the time in-between two) customer arrival events and
  (2) the service duration. In a class model, such random variables<a
  class="role-index-term">random variable</a> can be defined as special
  class-level ("static") operations, with a stereotype «rv», in the class to
  which they belong, as shown in the diagrams below.</p><p>We model the
  recurrence of customer arrival events as a discrete random variable with a
  uniform distribution between 1 and 6 minutes, which we express in the class
  diagram of the information design model by appending the symbolic expression
  <i>U{1-6}</i> within curly braces to the operation declaration, following
  the UML syntax for property/method modifiers.</p><p>We model the <i>service
  time</i> random variable with an empirical distribution of 2 minutes with
  probability 0.3, 3 minutes with probability 0.5 and 4 minutes with
  probability 0.2, using the symbolic expression <i>Freq{ 2:0.3, 3:0.5,
  4:0.2}</i>.</p><p>Computationally, object types and event types correspond
  to classes, either of an object-oriented information model, such as a UML
  class diagram, or of a computer program written in an object-oriented
  programming language, such as Java or
  JavaScript.</p><section><h4>1.2.1. ServiceDesk-0: Modeling
  <i>queueLength</i> as a global variable</h4><p>As discussed above, the
  simplest model for the service desk problem with maximum queue length
  statistics (available in the Sim4edu library as <a
  href="https://sim4edu.com/sims/14" target="_top">ServiceDesk-0</a>) has only
  one global variable: <i>queueLength</i>, which is a non-negative integer,
  and a global function for computing the random service time, but no object
  type.</p><p>An information model for ServiceDesk-0 consists of a special
  class for defining model variables and functions, and two classes for
  defining the event types <i>Arrival</i> and <i>Departure</i>, as shown in <a
  href="#figServiceDesk0"></a>.</p><figure id="figServiceDesk0"><figcaption>An
  information design model for ServiceDesk-0</figcaption><div><img alt="???"
  src="../IDM0.svg" width="360" /></div></figure><p>In addition to an
  information model, which captures the system's state structure, we also need
  to make a process model that captures the dynamics of the service desk
  system. The dynamics of a system consists of events triggering state changes
  and follow-up events. A process model can be expressed with the help of
  event rules, which define what happens when an event (of a certain type)
  occurs, or, more specifically, which state changes and which follow-up
  events are caused by an event of that type.</p><p>Event rules can be
  expressed with the help of a process model diagram or in pseudo-code, or in
  a simulation or programming language. The following <em>Event Graph</em>
  provides a process design model for the ServiceDesk-0 simulation scenario.
  Circles represent events (or, more precisely, event types) and arrows, which
  may be annotated with a delay expression, such as +serviceTime(), represent
  event scheduling relationships. An arrow with a mini-diamond at its source
  end represents a conditional event scheduling relationship where the
  condition is expressed in brackets below or above the
  arrow.</p><figure><figcaption>A process design model in the form of an Event

  have originally been proposed by L. Schruben (<a

  syntax has been improved and harmonized with BPMN in (<a

  the above Event Graph, expressed in pseudo-code.</p><table border="1"

  <i>queueLength</i> as an attribute</h4><p>In our extended model (<a
  href="https://sim4edu.com/sims/1" target="_top">ServiceDesk-1</a>) we
  represent the state variable <i>queueLength</i> as an attribute of an object
  type <i>ServiceDesk</i>. This results in a model with three classes, the
  object class <i>ServiceDesk</i> with an attribute <i>queueLength</i>, and
  the event classes <i>Arrival</i> and <i>Departure</i>, both with a reference
  property <i>serviceDesk</i> for referencing the service desk at which an
  event occurs. When we also want to compute the service utilization
  statistics, we need to add an attribute <i>serviceTime</i> to the
  <i>Departure</i> class for being able to update the service utilization
  statistics when a customer departs.</p><p>Both event types, <i>Arrival</i>
  and <i>Departure</i>, now have a many-to-one association with the object
  type <i>ServiceDesk</i>. This expresses the fact that any such event occurs
  at a particular service desk, which participates in the event. This
  association is implemented in the form of a reference property
  <i>serviceDesk</i> in each of the two event types, as shown in <a
  href="#figServiceDesk1"></a>.</p><figure id="figServiceDesk1"><figcaption>An
  information design model for ServiceDesk-1</figcaption><div><img alt="???"
  src="../IDM1.svg" width="400" /></div></figure><p>In addition to an
  information model, we need to make a process model, which captures the
  dynamics of the service desk system consisting of arrival and departure
  events triggering state changes and follow-up events. The following <em>DPMN
  Process Diagram</em> provides a process design model for the ServiceDesk-1
  simulation scenario. As in Event Graphs, circles represent event types and
  arrows represent event scheduling relationships. DPMN extends Event Graphs
  by adding object rectangles, attached to event circles, representing state
  change patterns for objects that are affected by events of that
  type.</p><figure><figcaption>A process design model in the form of a DPMN

  now account for the fact that both types of events occur at a particular
  service desk that is referenced by the event expression parameter
