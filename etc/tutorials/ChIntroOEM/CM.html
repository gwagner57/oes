    <title>Making a Conceptual Model of the System under Investigation</title>
  </head>
  <body><figure class="right"><img alt="" src="../service-desk.svg" width="200" /></figure><p>Let's look at an example. We model a system of one or
  more service desks, each of them having its own queue, as a discrete event system:</p><ul>
      <li>Customers arrive at a service desk at random times.</li>
      <li>If there is no other customer in front of them, and the service desk is available, they are served immediately, otherwise they have to queue
      up in a waiting line.</li>
      <li>The duration of services varies, depending on the individual case.</li>
      <li>When a service is completed, the customer departs and the next customer is served, if there is still any customer in the queue.</li>
    </ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>object types</b> of the system under investigation are:</p><ul>
      <li>customers,</li>
      <li>service desks,</li>
      <li>waiting lines,</li>
      <li>service clerks, if the service is performed by (one or more) clerks.</li>
    </ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>event types</b> are:</p><ul>
      <li>customer arrivals,</li>
      <li>service starts,</li>
      <li>service terminations,</li>
      <li>customer departures.</li>
    </ul></body>
