    <title>Defining a User Interface for User Interactions</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>In an event-based simulation, implicit actions bound to events of a
  certain type (representing <em>action events</em>) can be replaced by
  <em>user actions</em>, such that when an event of that type occurs, the
  simulation halts and the user gets the opportunity to perform an action (or
  take a decision) that determines how the simulation is continued. This type
  of interaction requires a suitable user interface that allows the user to
  enter values for action/decision parameters or select one of a number of
  possible actions.</p><p>A <em>user interaction user interface (UI)</em>
  allows defining user actions bound to events of a certain type. Such a UI
  turns a simulation into a game, or a <em>human-in-the-loop</em>
  simulation.</p><p>For instance, in the simulation of a lemonade stand (as an
  example of a manufacturing company), there could be an event type
  <i>StartOfDay</i> representing the start of a business day at which
  replenishment decisions have to be made. While these decisions would be made
  algorithmically in a normal simulation, a user interaction UI would allow a
  human user to make these decisions in a user-interactive (human-in-the-loop)
  simulation.</p><p>A user interaction (UIA) is triggered by a simulation
  event (of some type, possibly satisfying some condition) leading to the
  creation of a modal UIA window and an interruption of the simulation loop by
  having the browser wait for user input/actions. The UIA window contains the
  following UI elements: </p><ol>
      <li><em>output fields</em> for informing the user about the current
      values of critical state variables,</li>

      <li><em>input fields</em> allowing the user to enter values for decision
      variables, and</li>

      <li>one or more <em>buttons</em> (typically, a "continue" button allows
      confirming the choices made).</li>
    </ol><p>When the user confirms their choice(s) by activating the
  "continue" button, this triggers an event handler that restarts the
  simulator.</p></body>
