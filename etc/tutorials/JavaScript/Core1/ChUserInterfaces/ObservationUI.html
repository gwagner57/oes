    <title>Defining an Observation User Interface</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>An observation UI allows defining views for objects and events (and
  sounds for events) such that they can be visualized (and sonified) during a
  simulation run. Since OESjs is a framework for web-based simulation, an
  observation UI is based on the following Web technologies: CSS, SVG and <a

  Animations</a>. For learning more about SVG shapes and their attributes, see

  observe objects in a simulation run, they have to be visualized in some
  form. OESjs supports both the visualization of objects in space in
  <em>spatial models</em> and of objects in non-spatial models. </p><p>In a
  visualization of a non-spatial model, such as the ServiceDesk-1 model, all
  object views have to be explicitly positioned in an observation canvas.
  </p><p>In the case of our <em>ServiceDesk-1</em> model, we may, for
  instance, visualize the service desk using either an image or simply a
  fixed-size rectangle, and its queue in the form of a growing and shrinking
  bar.</p><p>Two-dimensional visualizations can be obtained by using the web
  technology of <em>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</em> in the definition of
  the observation UI. For defining an observation UI with SVG-based
  visualization, the following settings have to be made:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-1">sim.config.obs.ui.type = "SVG";
sim.config.obs.ui.canvas.width = 600;
sim.config.obs.ui.canvas.height = 300;</pre><p>In addition, one can define a
  CSS style for the canvas element in the following way, e.g., for setting a
  background color or background image:</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.config.obs.ui.canvas.<b>style</b> = "background-color: azure";</pre><p>Then
  we can define fixed elements of a visualization, giving each one a name
  (here: "desk") and defining an SVG shape with attributes and a CSS
  style:</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.config.obs.ui.<b>fixedElements</b> = {
  "desk": {
    shapeName: "rect",
    shapeAttributes: { x: 350, y: 200, width: 50, height: 30},
    style: "fill:brown; stroke-width:0"
  }
};</pre><p>The main issue in visualization is to visualize simulation objects
  by defining suitable views for them and then map some of their attributes to
  suitable visual parameters such as color, shape width and height, etc. A
  <b><i>view</i></b> can be defined either for all instances of an object type
  or for specific instances only.</p><p>For instance, we may want to visualize
  the waiting line of the object "serviceDesk1" in the form of a rectangle and
  map the service desk's <i>queueLength</i> attribute to the width of that
  rectangle, as in the following object view definition:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-1">sim.config.obs.ui.<b>objectViews</b> = {
  "<b>serviceDesk1</b>": {  // the name of the object
    visualizationAttributes: ["queueLength"],
    attributesViewItemsRecords: [
      { attributes:["queueLength"],
        viewItems: [  // a list of 2 view elements for the object <b>"</b>serviceDesk1<b>"</b>
          {shapeName: "rect",  // a rectangle
           shapeAttributes: {  // left-upper corner (x,y) as well as width and height
             x: sd =&gt; Math.max( 0, 330 - sd.queueLength * 20),
             width: sd =&gt; Math.min( 300, sd.queueLength * 20),
             y: 150, height: 80 },
           style:"fill:yellow; stroke-width:0"},
          {shapeName: "text",
           shapeAttributes: {x: 325, y: 250, textContent: sd =&gt; sd.queueLength},
           style: "font-size:14px; text-anchor:middle"}
    ]
  }
};</pre><p>Notice that the view consists of two elements: a rectangle and an
  attached text displaying the queue length. In the view definition, certain
  attributes are assigned a fixed value, while others are assigned a JS
  function expression, which codes the mapping of object attributes to visual
  parameters.</p><p>Alternatively, instead of defining a view for a specific
  service desk object, we can also define a view for all service desk objects,
  like so</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.config.obs.ui.<b>objectViews</b> = {
  "<b>ServiceDesk</b>": [  // the name of the object type/class
    { shapeName: "rect",  // a rectangle defined by 
      shapeAttributes: {  // left-upper corner (x,y) as well as width and height
        x: function (sd) {return Math.max( 0, 330 - sd.queueLength * 20);},
        width: function (sd) {return Math.min( 300, sd.queueLength * 20);},
        y: 150, height: 80
      },
      style:"fill:yellow; stroke-width:0"
    }
};</pre></section><section><h4>Visualizing Events</h4><p></p></section></body>
