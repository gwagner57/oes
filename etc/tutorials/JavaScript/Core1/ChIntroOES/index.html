    <title>Creating Object Event Simulations with OESjs-Core1</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>The JavaScript-based simulator <i>OESjs-Core1</i> implements the
  <i>Object Event Simulation (<a href="https://sim4edu.com/OES"
  target="_top">OES</a>)</i> paradigm, representing a general <i>Discrete
  Event Simulation</i> approach based on <i>object-oriented</i> modeling and
  <i>event scheduling</i>. </p><p>The code of an OESjs-Core1 simulation
  consists of (1) the OESjs-Core1 library files in the folder
  <kbd>OESjs-Core1</kbd>, (2) general library files in the <kbd>lib</kbd>
  folder and (3) the following files to be created by the simulation
  developer:</p><ol>
      <li>For each object type <i>ObjT</i>, a JS code file
      <kbd>ObjT.js</kbd>.</li>

      <li>For each event type <i>EvtT</i>, a JS code file
      <kbd>EvtT.js</kbd>.</li>

      <li>A <kbd>simulation.js</kbd> file defining further parts of the
      simulation, such as statistics variables and the initial state.</li>
    </ol><p>OESjs-Core1 supports three forms of simulations:</p><ol>
      <li><p>Standalone scenario simulations, which are good for getting a
      quick impression of a simulation model, e.g., by checking some simple
      statistics.</p></li>

      <li><p>Simple simulation experiments, which are defined as a set of
      replicated simulation scenario runs, providing summary statistics like
      mean, standard deviation, minimum/maximum and confidence intervals for
      each statistics variable defined in the underlying model.</p></li>

      <li><p>Parameter variation experiments, for which a set of experiment
      parameters with value sets are defined such that each experiment
      parameter corresponds to a model parameter. When an experiment is run,
      each experiment parameter value combination defines an experiment
      scenario, which is run repeatedly, according to the specified number or
      replications for collecting statistics.</p></li>
    </ol><p>OESjs-Core1 allows to define two or more simulation scenarios for
  a given model. While an experiment type is defined for a given model, an
  experiment of that type is run on top of a specific scenario.</p><p>Using a
  simulation library like OESjs-Core1 means that only the model-specific logic
  has to be coded (in the form of object types, event types, event routines
  and other functions for model-specific computations), but not the general
  simulator operations (e.g., time progression and statistics) and the
  environment handling (e.g., user interfaces for statistics
  output).</p><p>The following sections present the basic concepts of the
  OESjs<i>-Core1</i> simulation library, and show how to implement the service
  desk models described in <a
  href="../../../ChIntroOEM/index.html"></a>.</p></body>
