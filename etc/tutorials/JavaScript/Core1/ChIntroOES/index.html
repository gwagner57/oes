    <title>Creating Object Event Simulations with OESjs-Core1</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>The JavaScript-based simulator <a
  href="https://sim4edu.com/oesjs/core1/"><i>OESjs-Core1</i></a> implements
  the <i>Object Event Simulation (<a href="https://sim4edu.com/OES"
  target="_top">OES</a>)</i> paradigm, representing a general <i>Discrete
  Event Simulation</i> approach based on <i>object-oriented</i> modeling and
  <i>event scheduling</i>. </p><p>The code of an OESjs-Core1 simulation
  consists of (1) the OESjs-Core1 library files in the folder
  <kbd>OESjs-Core1</kbd>, (2) general library files in the <kbd>lib</kbd>
  folder and (3) the following files to be created by the simulation
  developer:</p><ol>
      <li>For each object type <i>ObjT</i>, a JS code file
      <kbd>ObjT.js</kbd>.</li>

      <li>For each event type <i>EvtT</i>, a JS code file
      <kbd>EvtT.js</kbd>.</li>

      <li>A <kbd>simulation.js</kbd> file defining further parts of the
      simulation, such as statistics variables and the initial state.</li>
    </ol><p>OESjs-Core1 supports three forms of simulations:</p><ol>
      <li><p>Standalone scenario simulations, which are good for getting a
      quick impression of a simulation model, e.g., by checking some simple
      statistics.</p></li>

      <li><p>Simple simulation experiments, which are defined as a set of
      replicated simulation scenario runs, providing summary statistics like
      mean, standard deviation, minimum/maximum and confidence intervals for
      each statistics variable defined in the underlying model.</p></li>

      <li><p>Parameter variation experiments, for which a set of experiment
      parameters with value sets are defined such that each experiment
      parameter corresponds to a model parameter. When an experiment is run,
      each experiment parameter value combination defines an experiment
      scenario, which is run repeatedly, according to the specified number or
      replications for collecting statistics.</p></li>
    </ol><p>OESjs-Core1 allows to define two or more simulation scenarios for
  a given model. While an experiment type is defined for a given model, an
  experiment of that type is run on top of a specific scenario.</p><p>Using a
  simulation library like OESjs Core1 means that only the model-specific logic
  has to be coded (in the form of object types, event types, event routines
  and other functions for model-specific computations), but not the general
  simulator operations (e.g., time progression and statistics) and the
  environment handling (e.g., user interfaces for statistics
  output).</p><p>The following sections present the basic concepts of the
  OESjs<i> </i>Core1 simulation library.</p><blockquote
  class="role-attention"><p>You can <a
  href="https://github.com/gwagner57/oes/blob/master/OESjs-Core2.zip">download
  OESjs-Core2</a> in the form of a ZIP archive file from the <a>OES GitHub
  repo</a>. After extracting the archive on your local disk, you can run any
  of its example models by going to its folder and loading its
  <kbd>index.html</kbd> file into your brwoser. You can create your own model
  by making a copy of one of the example model folders and using its code
  files a s starting point.</p><p>Since an OESjs simulation includes a JS
  worker file for running the simulator in its own thread separately from the
  main (user interface) thread, it cannot be run from the local file system
  without changing the browser's default configuration (due to the web
  security policy <a
  href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cors-csp-web-security-concepts-for-developers/"
  title="Cross-Origin Resource Sharing">CORS</a>).</p><p>For developing OESjs
  simulations on your computer, you should use <em>Firefox</em> because its
  security settings can be easily configured such that it allows loading JS
  worker files directly from the local file system by disabling the flag
  "strict_origin_policy" specifically for file URLs:</p><ol type="1">
      <li><p>Enter "<strong>about:config</strong>" in the Firefox search
      bar.</p></li>

      <li><p>Search for
      "<strong>security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy</strong>".</p></li>

      <li><p>Disable this policy by changing its value from
      <strong>true</strong> to <strong>false</strong>.</p></li>
    </ol><p>This creates only a small security risk because the web security
  policy called "CORS" is only disabled for file URLs, but not for normal
  URLs.</p><p>For other browsers, like Chrome, you need to install a local
  HTTP server and load your simulation's <i>index.html</i> file from that
  local server, or run it via the JS development tool <em>WebStorm</em> (which
  has a built-in local server), because the only option for loading JS worker
  files from the local file system in Chrome would be to disable the CORS
  policy completely (see <a
  href="https://windowsreport.com/browser-not-support-cross-origin/"
  target="_top">how to disable CORS in Chrome</a>), but that would create a
  more severe security risk and is therefore not
  recommended.</p></blockquote></body>
