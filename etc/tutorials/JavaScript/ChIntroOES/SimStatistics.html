    <title>Statistics</title>
  </head>
  <body><p>In scientific and engineering simulation projects the main goal is getting estimates of the values of certain variables or performance
  indicators with the help of statistical methods. In educational simulations, statistics can be used for observing simulation runs and for learning
  the dynamics of a simulation model. </p><p>For collecting statistics, suitable <em>statistics variables</em> have to be defined, each of them with a
  <em>name</em> and a <em>range</em>. Only if a <em>label</em> is defined for them, they are shown in the statistics output view</p><p>The following
  code defines statistics variables for the service desk model.</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.model.statistics = {
  "arrivedCustomers": {range:"NonNegativeInteger", label:"Arrived customers"},
  "departedCustomers": {range:"NonNegativeInteger", label:"Departed customers"},
  "totalServiceTime": {range:"NonNegativeInteger"},
  "serviceUtilization": {range:"Decimal", label:"Service utilization",
      computeOnlyAtEnd: true, decimalPlaces: 1, unit: "%",
      expression: () =&gt; sim.stat.totalServiceTime / sim.time * 100
  },
  "maxQueueLength": {objectType:"ServiceDesk", objectIdRef: 1,
      property:"queueLength", aggregationFunction:"max", label:"Max. queue length"},
  "averageQueueLength": {objectType:"ServiceDesk", objectIdRef: 1,
    property:"queueLength", aggregationFunction:"avg", label:"Avg. queue length"},
  "queueLength": {objectType:"ServiceDesk", objectIdRef: 1,
    property:"queueLength", showTimeSeries: true, label:"Queue length"}
};</pre><p>The first three statistics variables (<i>arrivedCustomers</i>, <i>departedCustomers</i> and <i>totalServiceTime</i>) are simple variables
  that are updated in event routines (that is, in <i>onEvent</i> methods).</p><p>The <i>serviceUtilization</i> variable is only computed at the end of
  a simulation run by evaluating the <em>expression</em> specified for it (in the form of a JS <em>arrow function</em>). Notice that the expression on
  the right hand side of the arrow divides the total service time by the simulation time multiplied by 100 (for getting a percentage). </p><p>In the
  case of the remaining three variables, the data source is the object property <code>queueLength</code> of the service desk object with id=1. For the
  variable <code>maxQueueLength</code> the built-in aggregation function <code>max</code> is applied to this data source, computing the maximum of all
  <i>queueLength</i> values, while for the variable <code>averageQueueLength</code> the aggregation function <code>avg</code> is applied. The last
  variable, <i>queueLength</i>, is defined for the purpose of getting a time series chart. In such a chart, the y-value can be scaled by specifying a
  suitable scaling factor as the value of <code>timeSeriesScalingFactor</code>.</p><p>The statistics results are shown in a default view of the
  statistics output. It is an option to define a non-standard user interface for the statistics output.</p></body>
