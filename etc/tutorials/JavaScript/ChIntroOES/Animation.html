  <body><p>Animation is important for educational simulations and games, but
  it can also be used as a general tool for testing, inspecting and validating
  simulations.</p><p>Simulation runs can be animated by <em>visualizing</em>
  objects and events, by <em>sonifying</em> events and by allowing human users
  to <em>interact</em> with the simulated world. OESjs allows adding the
  following user interfaces (UI) to a simulation model:</p><ol>
      <li>An <strong>observation UI</strong> defines various kinds of
      visualizations (including 3D) for allowing the user to observe what is
      going on during a simulation run. Space models, objects and events can
      be visualized by defining a <em>view</em> for them. An <em>object
      view</em> is defined by a 2D shape (like a <em>rectangle</em> or a
      <em>polygon</em>) or a 3D shape (like a <em>cuboid</em> or a
      <em>mesh</em>). An <em>event view</em> consists of an animation defined
      in the form of a <em>Web Animation</em> (of one or more DOM elements
      using key frames). Events can also be <em>sonified</em> by attaching
      specific sounds to event occurrences in an event appearance
      definition.</li>

      <li>A <strong>user interaction UI</strong> allows human users to
      interact with a running simulation by taking decisions on the values of
      decision variables or by taking actions that change the value of certain
      simulation variables.</li>

      <li>A <strong>participation UI</strong> allows human users to
      participate in a multi-agent simulation scenario by receiving
      situational information and by performing in-world actions via the user
      interface. Any multi-agent simulation model can be turned into a
      user-interactive <em>participatory simulation</em> by adding a
      <em>participation model</em> and a corresponding UI.</li>
    </ol><section><h4>2.7.1. Adding an Observation User Interface</h4><p>For
  being able to observe a simulation run, some form of visualization has to be
  defined. OESjs supports both the visualization of <em>spatial models</em>
  and of non-spatial models. In a visualization of a non-spatial model, such
  as the Service-Desk-1 model, all object views have to be explicitly
  positioned in an observation canvas. Rich two-dimensional visualizations can
  be obtained by using the web technology of <em>Scalable Vector Graphics
  (SVG)</em> in the definition of the observation UI.</p><p>In the case of our
  <em>Service-Desk-1</em> model, we may, for instance, visualize the service
  desk using either an image or simply a fixed-size rectangle, and its queue
  in the form of a growing and shrinking bar.</p><p>For defining an
  observation UI with SVG-based visualization, the following settings have to
  be made:</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.config.observationUI.type = "SVG";
sim.config.observationUI.canvas.width = 600;
sim.config.observationUI.canvas.height = 300;</pre><p>In addition, one can
  define a CSS style for the canvas element in the following way, e.g. for
  setting a background color or background image:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-1">sim.config.observationUI.canvas.<b>style</b> = "background-color: azure";</pre><p>Then
  we can define fixed elements of a visualization, giving each one a name
  (here: "desk") and defining an SVG shape with attributes and a CSS
  style:</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.config.observationUI.<b>fixedElements</b> = {
  "desk": {
    shapeName: "rect",
    shapeAttributes: { x: 350, y: 200, width: 50, height: 30},
    style: "fill:brown; stroke-width:0"
  }
};</pre><p>For learning more about SVG shapes and their attributes, see the
  book chapter <a href="http://svgpocketguide.com/book/#section-2"
  target="_top">Basic Shapes &amp; Paths</a> by Joni Trythall. For learning
  more about CSS styling of SVG elements, see <a
  href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/styling-and-animating-svgs-with-css/"
  target="_top">Styling And Animating SVGs With CSS</a> by Sara
  Soueidan.</p><p>The main issue in visualization is to visualize simulation
  objects by defining suitable views for them and then map certain attributes
  to suitable visual parameters such as colors, shape size, etc. A
  <b><i>visualization view</i></b> can be defined either for all instances of
  an object type or for specific instances only.</p><p>For instance, we may
  want to visualize the waiting line of the object "serviceDesk1" in the form
  of a rectangle and map the service desk's <i>queueLength</i> attribute to
  the width of that rectangle, as in the following object view
  definition:</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.config.observationUI.<b>objectViews</b> = {
  "<b>serviceDesk1</b>": [  // a view of the queue
    { shapeName: "rect",  // a rectangle defined by 
      shapeAttributes: {  // left-upper corner (x,y) as well as width and height
        x: function (sd) {return Math.max( 0, 330 - sd.queueLength * 20);},
        width: function (sd) {return Math.min( 300, sd.queueLength * 20);},
        y: 150, height: 80
      },
      style:"fill:yellow; stroke-width:0"
    },
    { shapeName: "text",
      shapeAttributes: {x: 325, y: 250,
          textContent: function (sd) {return sd.queueLength;}},
      style: "font-size:14px; text-anchor:middle"
    }
  ]
};</pre><p>Notice that the view consists of two elements: a rectangle and an
  attached text displaying the queue length. In the view definition, certain
  attributes are assigned a fixed value, while others are assigned a JS
  function expression, which codes the mapping of object attributes to visual
  parameters.</p><p>Alternatively, instead of defining a view for a specific
  service desk object, we can also define a view for all service desk objects,
  like so</p><pre class="role-listing-1">sim.config.observationUI.<b>objectViews</b> = {
  "<b>ServiceDesk</b>": [
    { shapeName: "rect",  // a rectangle defined by 
      shapeAttributes: {  // left-upper corner (x,y) as well as width and height
        x: function (sd) {return Math.max( 0, 330 - sd.queueLength * 20);},
        width: function (sd) {return Math.min( 300, sd.queueLength * 20);},
        y: 150, height: 80
      },
      style:"fill:yellow; stroke-width:0"
    }
};</pre><p>Whenever a model is about objects that are located in a
  two-dimensional discrete space, also called <strong>gridspace</strong>,
  it</p></section></body>
