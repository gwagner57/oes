    <title>Verification and Validation with Constraints</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>Simulation models and scenarios can be verified or validated with
  the help of various kinds of integrity constraints:</p><ol>
      <li><p>The OESjs simulator has a number of <em><strong>built-in</strong>
      property and model <strong>constraints</strong></em>, which are checked
      automatically or on demand:</p><ol>
          <li>Many simulator objects, such as <code>sim.model</code>,
          <code>sim.scenario</code> and <code>sim.config</code>, have
          pre-defined property constraints that allow validating their
          property values set in the <kbd>simulation.js</kbd> file. </li>

          <li>For any particular class of simulation models, e.g., for
          Processing Network models, the OESjs simulator may have pre-defined
          model constraints that can be checked at each simulation step for
          verifying certain model correctness properties.</li>
        </ol></li>

      <li><p>A simulation developer can define <strong><em>property
      constraints</em></strong> within the definition of object and event
      types for allowing the simulator to verify that the values of properties
      are valid.</p></li>

      <li><p>A simulation developer can define <strong><em>model
      constraints</em></strong> for allowing the simulator to verify that the
      model satisfies certain correctness properties.</p></li>
    </ol><p>Constraint checking is useful in the development of new simulation
  models, since it allows to catch a number of errors a developer may make.
  When a simulation has been sufficiently tested and is to be deployed for
  operational usage, constraint checking will normally be turned off in favor
  of simulation execution speed.</p></body>
