    <title>Simulation Space</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>A simulation model may have an underlying <b><i>space
  model</i></b>. While in the real world, we live in a three-dimensional
  continuous space, a simulation model can be based on a simplified space
  model such as </p><ol>
      <li>a two-dimensional continuous space,</li>

      <li>a two-dimensional discrete space, also called <em>grid
      space</em>,</li>

      <li>a one-dimensional continuous, or discrete, space,</li>

      <li>a <em>graph space</em> consisting of a set of locations, which may,
      or may not, be connected with each other. </li>
    </ol><p>OESjs 1.4 only supports grid space, but other space models will be
  supported in future versions. For defining a grid space model in
  <kbd>simulation.js</kbd>, the following settings have to be made:</p><pre>sim.model.space.type = "IntegerGrid";
sim.model.space.xMax = 500;
sim.model.space.yMax = 300;</pre><p>The OESjs Integer Grid space model allows
  large grid spaces with large populations. An example of a grid space model
  using Integer Grid is the <a
