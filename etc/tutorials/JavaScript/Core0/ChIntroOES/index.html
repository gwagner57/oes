    <title>Creating Object Event Simulations with OESjs-Core0</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>The JavaScript-based simulator <i>OESjs-Core0</i> implements the
  <i>Object Event Simulation (<a href="https://sim4edu.com/OES"
  target="_top">OES</a>)</i> paradigm, representing a general <i>Discrete
  Event Simulation</i> approach based on <i>object-oriented</i> modeling and
  <i>event scheduling</i>. In OES, a model normally defines various types of
  objects and events, but OESjs-Core0 also supports models without objects, if
  they define state variables in the form of global <i>model variables</i>,
  instead.</p><p>An OESjs-Core0 simulation consists of the OESjs-Core0 library
  code and the following files to be created by the simulation
  developer:</p><ol>
      <li>For each object type <i>ObjT</i>, a JS code file
      <kbd>ObjT.js</kbd>.</li>

      <li>For each event type <i>EvtT</i>, a JS code file
      <kbd>EvtT.js</kbd>.</li>

      <li>A <kbd>simulation.js</kbd> file defining further parts of the
      simulation, such as statistics variables and the initial state.</li>
    </ol><p>OESjs-Core0 supports two forms of simulations:</p><ol>
      <li><p>Standalone scenario simulations, which are good for getting a
      quick impression of a simulation model, e.g., by checking some simple
      statistics.</p></li>

      <li><p>Simple simulation experiments, which are defined as a set of
      replicated simulation scenario runs, providing summary statistics like
      mean, standard deviation, minimum/maximum and confidence intervals for
      each statistics variable defined in the underlying model.</p></li>
    </ol><p>Using a simulation library like OESjs-Core0 means that only the
  model-specific logic has to be coded (in the form of object types, event
  types, event routines and other functions for model-specific computations),
  but not the general simulator operations (e.g., time progression and
  statistics) and the environment handling (e.g., user interfaces for
  statistics output).</p><p>The following sections present the basic concepts
  of the OESjs<i>-Core0</i> simulation library, and show how to implement the
  service desk models described in <a
  href="../../../ChIntroOEM/index.html"></a>.</p><blockquote
  class="role-attention"><p>While you can directly run an OESjs Core1
  simulation model from a remote website (e.g., from the OES GitHub website),
  you can only run it from your local file system after changing your
  browser's default configuration. For FireFox, you have to set the
  configuration property <code>privacy.file_unique_origin</code> to
  <i>false</i> by entering <code>about:config</code> in the browser's web
  address bar.</p></blockquote></body>
