    <title>Simulator Architecture</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>OES Core 0 is the minimal architecture for an OE simulator,
  supporting</p><ul>
      <li>model variables</li>

      <li>object types and event types, including <em>exogenous</em> event
      types with <code>recurrence</code> and <code>nextEvent</code>
      functions</li>

      <li>next-event time progression</li>

      <li>the uniform distribution as the only representative of probability
      distributions</li>

      <li>simple simulation experiments with the (unseeded) random number
      generator provided by the host programming language.</li>
    </ul><p>The OES Core 0 simulator's information architecture is described
  by the following class diagram, which defines the names of classes,
  properties and methods/functions:</p><figure><img
