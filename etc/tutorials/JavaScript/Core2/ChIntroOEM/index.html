    <title>Introduction to Object Event Modeling of Activities</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>This chapter shows how to make <em>activity-based Discrete Event
  Simulation models</em> using the paradigm of <em>Object Event Modeling and
  Simulation</em> (OEM&amp;S) with UML Class Diagrams and DPMN Process
  Diagrams. It is recommended to first read the tutorial <a
  href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core1/tutorial.html">Discrete Event
  Simulation with OESjs-Core1</a>.</p>Activities are composite events, having
  a start event and an end event, and a duration as the time in-between their
  start and end events.<p>For modeling a discrete dynamic system with
  activities, we have to</p><ol>
      <li>describe the <b>object types</b>, <b>event types</b> and
      <strong>activity types</strong> of the system (in an <em>information
      model</em>);</li>

      <li>describe for any <strong>resource-constrained activity
      type</strong>, its resource roles and associated resource pools (in the
      <em>information model</em>);</li>

      <li>specify, for any event type, the <b>state changes</b> of objects and
      the <b>follow-up events</b> caused by the occurrence of an event of that
      type (in a <em>process model</em>);</li>

      <li>specify, for any activity type, the <b>state changes</b> of objects
      and <b>follow-up events</b> caused by start and end events of activities
      of that type (in the <em>process model</em>).</li>
