    <title>Making a Conceptual Model of the System under Investigation</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>As our first example, we consider a basic model of a medical
  department of a hospital with just one type of activity, <em>medical
  examinations</em>, and one type of resource, <em>doctors</em>. In our second
  example this model is extended by adding two other resource types,
  <em>examination rooms</em> and <em>nurses</em>, and another type of
  activity: <em>walks to rooms</em> (the walks of patients to examination
  rooms guided by nurses).</p><section><h4>A basic conceptual model </h4><p>In
  our basic model of a medical department we consider just one activity,
  <em>medical examinations</em>, and one type of resource,
  <em>doctors</em>:</p><ul>
      <li>Patients arrive at a medical department at random times.</li>

      <li>If there are no other planned examinations waiting for the
      availability of a doctor, and a doctor is available, any newly arrived
      patient is immediately examined by that doctor. Otherwise, the planned
      examination of the newly arrived patient is added to a list of planned
      examinations (representing a queue).</li>

      <li>The duration of examinations varies, depending on the individual
      case.</li>

      <li>When an examination by a doctor is completed, the next planned
      examination is started by the doctor, if there is still any planned
      examination in the queue.</li>
    </ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>object types</b> of the system under
  investigation are:</p><ul>
      <li>patients,</li>

      <li>medical departments,</li>

      <li>doctors.</li>
    </ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>event types</b> are:</p><ul>
      <li>patient arrivals,</li>

      <li>examination starts,</li>

      <li>examination ends,</li>
    </ul><p>Instead of considering the event types <em>examination starts</em>
  and <em>examination ends</em>, we can consider the activity type
  <em>examinations</em>. Thus, we get the following conceptual information
  model (expressed as an <abbr style="Object-Event">OE</abbr> Class Diagram,
  which is a special type of UML class diagram):</p><figure
  id="figServiceDesk0"><div><img alt="???" src="../img/MedDep_CIM1.svg"
  width="600" /></div></figure><p>From the diagram we can infer that:</p><ul>
      <li>For <em>patient arrivals</em> and for <em>examinations</em>, there
      is an association with <em>medical departments</em> providing the
      <em>process owner</em>, such that for any <em>patient arrival</em> event
      and <em>examination</em> activity a specific <em>medical department</em>
      is in charge of handling the event or seeing to it that the activity is
      going to be performed.</li>

      <li>While <em>patient arrivals</em> have two participants: a
      <em>patient</em> and a <em>medical department</em>,
      <em>examinations</em> have three participants: a <em>patient</em>, a
      <em>medical department</em> and a <em>doctor</em>.</li>

      <li><em>Examinations</em> have one resource role, <em>doctor</em>, with
      a resource cardinality constraint of exactly one, which means that
      exactly one <em>doctor</em> is required for performing an
      <em>examination</em>.</li>

      <li>The process owner of an <em>examination</em>, a <em>medical
      department</em>, has a resource pool for <em>doctors</em>. The
      <em>doctors</em> needed for performing <em>examinations</em> at this
      department are allocated from this pool, and the department, as the
      process owner of <em>examinations</em>, has a business procedure for
      allocating <em>doctors</em> to planned <em>examinations</em> (using
      certain policies).</li>
    </ul><p>In addition to a conceptual information model, which captures the
  system's state structure, we also need to make a conceptual process model
  that captures the dynamics of the system. A process model can be expressed
  with the help of <em>event rules</em>, which define what happens when an
  event (of a certain type) occurs, or, more specifically, which <em>state
  changes</em> and which <em>follow-up events</em> are caused by an event of
  that type.</p><p>The following conceptual process model (in the form of a
  DPMN Process Diagram) is based on the information model above. It refers to
  a medical department as the <em>process owner</em>, visualized in the form
  of a container rectangle (called "Pool" in BPMN, but not in DPMN), and to
  <i>doctor objects</i>, as well as to the event type <i>patient arrivals</i>
  and to the activity type <i>examinations</i>.</p><figure><div><img alt="???"
  src="../img/MedDep_CPM1.svg" width="600" /></div></figure><p>This conceptual
  process model describes two causal regularities in the form of the following
  two event rules, each stated with two bullet points: one for describing the
  state changes and one for describing the follow-up events brought about by
  applying the rule.</p><ol>
      <li><p>When a new patient arrives:</p><ul>
          <li>if a doctor is available, then she is allocated to the
          examination of that patient; otherwise, a new planned examination is
          queued up;</li>

          <li>if a doctor has been allocated, then start an examination of the
          patient.</li>
        </ul></li>

      <li><p>When an examination is completed by a doctor:</p><ul>
          <li>if the queue of planned examinations is empty, then the doctor
          is released;</li>

          <li>otherwise, the next planned examination by that doctor starts
          immediately.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ol><p>We can simplify the model by using a <em>Resource-Dependent
  Activity Start</em> arrow between the <em>patient arrivals</em> event type
  circle and the <em>examinations</em> activity type rectangle, as shown in
  the following DPMN process diagram: </p><figure><div><img alt="???"

  id="sectExtendedConceptualModel"><h4>An extended conceptual model
  </h4><p>For being more realistic, we consider the fact that patients first
  need to be walked by nurses to the room allocated to their examination
  before the examination can start. So, in our extended model of a medical
  department we consider two other resource types, <em>examination rooms</em>
  and <em>nurses</em>, and another type of activity: <em>walks to rooms</em>
  (the walks of patients to examination rooms guided by nurses):</p><ul>
      <li>Patients arrive at a medical department at random times.</li>

      <li>When a new patient arrives, and an examination room and a nurse are
      available, that nurse walks the patient to that room, otherwise the
      patient has to wait for the availability of an examination room and a
      nurse (administratively, a new planned walk is added to the queue/list
      of planned walks).</li>

      <li>When a nurse has walked a patient to a room and a doctor is
      available, an examination of the patient by that doctor in the room
      starts; otherwise the patient has to wait for the availability of a
      doctor (administratively, a new planned examination is placed in the
      queue/list of planned examinations).</li>

      <li><p>When an examination of a patient by a doctor in a room is
      completed,</p><ol>
          <li>if there is still another planned examination of a patient
          waiting in a room for the availability of a doctor, the doctor goes
          to that room and starts the examination of that patient; otherwise,
          the planned examination of the newly arrived patient is added to a
          list of planned examinations (representing a queue);</li>

          <li>if there is still another planned walk of a patient to a room
          waiting for the availability of a room, the room is allocated to
          this planned walk; if a nurse is available, she walks the patient to
          that room.</li>
        </ol></li>

      <li>The duration of walks and examinations varies, depending on the
      individual case.</li>
    </ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>object types</b> of the system under
  investigation are: <em>patients</em>, <em>medical departments</em>,
  <em>rooms</em>, <em>nurses</em> and <em>doctors</em>.</p><p>The potentially
  relevant <b>event types</b> are <em>patient arrivals</em> and the activity
  types <em>walks to rooms</em> and <em>examinations</em>.</p><p>Thus, we get
  the following conceptual information model expressed as an <abbr
  style="Object-Event">OE</abbr> class diagram:</p><figure><div><img alt="???"
  src="../img/MedDep_CIM2.svg" width="600" /></div></figure><p>Notice that in
  this model, (a) the performer role is explicitly marked with «performer»: a
  <em>nurse</em> is a performer of <em>walks to room</em> while a
  <em>doctor</em> is a performer of <em>examinations</em>, and (b) the
  stereotypes «resource role» and «resource pool» have been abbreviated by
  «rr» and «rp». </p><p>From the diagram we can infer that:</p><ul>
      <li>For the event type <em>patient arrivals</em> and for the activity
      types <em>walks to rooms</em> and <em>examinations</em>, there is an
      association with <em>medical departments</em> providing the <em>process
      owner</em>.</li>

      <li>While <em>patient arrivals</em> have two participants: a
      <em>patient</em> and a <em>medical department</em>, <em>walks</em> and
      <em>examinations</em> have four participants: a <em>medical
      department</em>, a <em>patient</em>, a <em>nurse</em> or a
      <em>doctor</em>, and a <em>room</em>.</li>

      <li><em>Walks</em> have two resource roles, <em>nurse</em> and
      <em>room</em>, both with a resource cardinality constraint of exactly
      one, which means that exactly one <em>nurse</em> and one <em>room</em>
      are required for performing a <em>walk</em>.</li>

      <li><em>Examinations</em> have two resource roles, <em>doctor</em> and
      <em>room</em>, both with a resource cardinality constraint of exactly
      one.</li>

      <li>The process owner of a <em>walk to a room</em> and a subsequent
      <em>examination</em>, a <em>medical department</em>, has three resource
      pools for <em>nurses</em>, <em>rooms</em> and <em>doctors</em>. All
      required resources needed for performing <em>walks to room</em> and
      <em>examinations</em> at this department are allocated from these pools,
      and the department has corresponding business procedures for allocating
      rooms, nurses and doctors using certain allocation policies.</li>
    </ul><p>In addition to a conceptual information model, which captures the
  system's state structure, we also need to make a conceptual process model
  that captures the dynamics of the system. A process model can be expressed
  with the help of event rules, which define what happens when an event (of a
  certain type) occurs, or, more specifically, which state changes and which
  follow-up events are caused by an event of that type.</p><p>The following
  conceptual process model (in the form of a DPMN Process Diagram) is based on
  the information model above. It refers to the object types <i>medical
  departments</i> and <i>doctors</i>, as well as to the event type <i>patient
  arrivals</i> and to the activity type
  <i>examinations</i>.</p><figure><div><img alt="???"
  src="../img/MedDep_CPM2.svg" width="700" /></div></figure><p>This process
  model describes three causal regularities in the form of the following three
  event rules:</p><ol>
      <li><p>When a new patient arrives:</p><ul>
          <li>if a room and a nurse are available, they are allocated to the
          walk of that patient to that room, otherwise a new planned walk is
          placed in the corresponding queue;</li>

          <li>if a room has been allocated, then the nurse starts walking the
          patient to the room.</li>
        </ul></li>

      <li><p>When a walk of a patient and nurse to a room is completed:</p><ul>
          <li>if there is still a planned walk in the queue and a room is
          available, then the room is allocated and the nurse is re-allocated
          to the walk of the next patient to that room;<br />if a doctor is
          available, she is allocated to the examination of that patient, else
          a new planned examination of that patient is queued up;</li>

          <li>if a doctor has been allocated, then the examination of the
          patient starts;<br />if the nurse has been re-allocated, she starts
          walking the next patient to the allocated room.</li>
        </ul></li>

      <li><p>When an examination of a patient is completed by a doctor in a
      particular room:</p><ul>
          <li>if there is still a planned examination (of another patient in
          another room), the doctor is re-allocated to that planned
          examination, else the doctor is released;<br />if the waiting line
          is not empty, the room is re-allocated to the next patient, else it
          is released;</li>

          <li>if the doctor has been re-allocated to a planned examination,
          that examination starts;<br />if the room has been re-allocated to
          another patient and a nurse is available, that nurse starts walking
          the patient to the room.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ol><p>Again, we can simplify the model by using <em>Resource-Dependent
  Activity Start</em> arrows resulting in an <i>Activity Network</i> model, as
  shown in the following DPMN process diagram:</p><figure><div><img alt="???"
  src="../img/MedDep_CPM2a.svg" width="400" /></div></figure><p>We can display
  the two performer roles <em>doctor</em> and <em>nurse</em> with the help of
  two corresponding swimlanes shown within the process owner
  rectangle:</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="../img/MedDep_CPM2b.svg"
  width="300" /></div></figure><p>Notice that the use of swimlanes (marking
  disjoint subrectangles) is a convenient visual syntax for displaying the
  performer roles when the different performers have a non-overlapping set of
  activity types. However, when activities of a certain type are performed
  jointly by more than one performer (e.g., when a doctor and a nurse jointly
  perform an examination), a different visual syntax needs to be
  introduced.</p></section></body>
