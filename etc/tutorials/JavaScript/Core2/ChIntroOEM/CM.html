    <title>Making a Conceptual Model of the System under Investigation</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>As our first example, we consider a basic model of a medical
  department of a hospital with just one type of activity, <em>medical
  examinations</em>, and one type of resource, <em>doctors</em>. In our second
  example this model is extended by adding two other resource types,
  <em>examination rooms</em> and <em>nurses</em>, and another type of
  activity: <em>walks to rooms</em> (the walks of patients to examination
  rooms guided by nurses).</p><section><h4>A basic conceptual model </h4><p>In
  our basic model of a medical department we consider just one activity,
  <em>medical examinations</em>, and one type of resource,
  <em>doctors</em>:</p><ul>
      <li>Patients arrive at a medical department at random times.</li>

      <li>If there are no other planned examinations waiting for the
      availability of a doctor, and a doctor is available, any newly arrived
      patient is immediately examined by that doctor. Otherwise, the planned
      examination of the newly arrived patient is added to a list of planned
      examinations (representing a queue).</li>

      <li>The duration of examinations varies, depending on the individual
      case.</li>

      <li>When an examination by a doctor is completed, the next planned
      examination is started by the doctor, if there is still any planned
      examination in the queue.</li>
    </ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>object types</b> of the system under
  investigation are:</p><ul>
      <li>patients,</li>

      <li>medical departments,</li>

      <li>doctors.</li>
    </ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>event types</b> are:</p><ul>
      <li>patient arrivals,</li>

      <li>examination starts,</li>

      <li>examination ends,</li>
    </ul><p>Instead of considering the event types <em>examination starts</em>
  and <em>examination ends</em>, we can consider the activity type
  <em>examinations</em>. Thus, we get the following conceptual information
  model (expressed as an OEM Class Diagram, which is a special type of UML
  class diagram):</p><figure id="figServiceDesk0"><div><img alt="???"
  src="../img/MedExam_CIM1.svg" width="600" /></div></figure><p>From the
  diagram we can infer that:</p><ul>
      <li>For patient arrivals and for examinations, there is an association
      with medical departments providing the <em>process owner</em>, such that
      for any patient arrival event and examination activity a specific
      medical department is in charge of handling the event or seeing to it
      that the activity is going to be performed.</li>

      <li>While patient arrivals have two participants: a patient and a
      medical department, examinations have three participants: a patient, a
      medical department and a doctor.</li>

      <li>Examinations have one resource role, doctor, with a resource
      constraint of exactly one, which means that exactly one doctor is
      required for performing an examination.</li>

      <li>The process owner of an examination, a medical department, has a
      resource pool for doctors. The doctors needed for performing
      examinations at this department are allocated from this pool, and the
      department, as the process owner of examinations, has a business
      procedure for allocating doctors to planned examinations (using certain
      policies).</li>
    </ul><p>In addition to a conceptual information model, which captures the
  system's state structure, we also need to make a conceptual process model
  that captures the dynamics of the system. A process model can be expressed
  with the help of <em>event rules</em>, which define what happens when an
  event (of a certain type) occurs, or, more specifically, which <em>state
  changes</em> and which <em>follow-up events</em> are caused by an event of
  that type.</p><p>The following conceptual process model (in the form of a
  DPMN Process Diagram) is based on the information model above. It refers to
  the object types <i>medical departments</i> and <i>doctors</i>, as well as
  to the event type <i>patient arrivals</i> and to the activity type
  <i>examinations</i>.</p><figure><div><img alt="???"
  src="../img/MedDep_CPM1.svg" width="600" /></div></figure><p>This conceptual
  process model describes two causal regularities in the form of the following
  two event rules, each stated with two bullet points: one for describing the
  state changes and one for describing the follow-up events brought about by
  applying the rule.</p><ol>
      <li><p>When a new patient arrives:</p><ul>
          <li>if a doctor is available, then she is allocated to the
          examination of that patient; otherwise, a new planned examination is
          queued up;</li>

          <li>if a doctor has been allocated, then start an examination of the
          patient.</li>
        </ul></li>

      <li><p>When an examination is completed by a doctor:</p><ul>
          <li>if the queue of planned examinations is empty, then the doctor
          is released;</li>

          <li>otherwise, the next planned examination by that doctor starts
          immediately.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ol></section><section><h4>An extended conceptual model </h4><p>For being
  more realistic, we consider the fact that patients first need to be walked
  by nurses to the room allocated to their examination before the examination
  can start. So, in our extended model of a medical department we consider two
  other resource types, <em>examination rooms</em> and <em>nurses</em>, and
  another type of activity: <em>walks to rooms</em> (the walks of patients to
  examination rooms guided by nurses):</p><ul>
      <li>Patients arrive at a medical department at random times.</li>

      <li>When a new patient arrives, and a room and a nurse are available,
      that nurse walks the patient to that room, otherwise the patient has to
      wait for the availability of a room and a nurse (administratively, a new
      planned walk is placed in the queue/list of planned walks).</li>

      <li>When a nurse has walked a patient to a room and a doctor is
      available, an examination of the patient by that doctor in the room
      starts; otherwise the patient has to wait for the availability of a
      doctor (administratively, a new planned examination is placed in the
      queue/list of planned examinations).</li>

      <li><p>When an examination of a patient by a doctor in a room is
      completed,</p><ol>
          <li>if there is still another planned examination of a patient
          waiting in a room for the availability of a doctor, the doctor goes
          to that room and starts the examination of that patient; otherwise,
          the planned examination of the newly arrived patient is added to a
          list of planned examinations (representing a queue); </li>

          <li>if there is still another planned walk of a patient to a room
          waiting for the availability of a room, the room is allocated to
          this planned walk; if a nurse is available, she walks the patient to
          that room.</li>
        </ol></li>

      <li>The duration of walks and examinations varies, depending on the
      individual case.</li>
    </ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>object types</b> of the system under
  investigation are: <em>patients</em>, <em>medical departments</em>,
  <em>rooms</em>, <em>nurses</em> and <em>doctors</em>.</p><p>The potentially
  relevant <b>event types</b> are <em>patient arrivals</em> and the activity
  types <em>walks to rooms</em> and <em>examinations</em>.</p><p>Thus, we get
  the following conceptual information model expressed as an OEM Class
  Diagram:</p><figure id="figServiceDesk0"><div><img alt="???"
