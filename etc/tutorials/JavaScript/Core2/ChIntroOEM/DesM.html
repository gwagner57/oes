    <title>Making Simulation Design Models</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>When making a simulation design based on a conceptual model of the
  system under investigation, we may abstract away from certain items of the
  conceptual model for obtaining a sufficiently simple design. The right
  degree of abstraction depends on the purpose of the model.</p><p>In our
  example of a medical department, the purpose of the simulation model is to
  compute the <em>maximum queue length</em> and the <em>resource
  utilization</em> for all types of activities. So, we may abstract away from
  the object type <em>patients</em> since we don't need any information about
  individual patients. If we don't need utilization statistics per doctor, but
  only the average utilization of all doctors, then we may also abstract away
  from the object type <i>doctors</i> This is the approach chosen in our
  design models <i>Medical-Department-1a</i> and <i>Medical-Department-1b</i>,
  while we keep the object type <i>doctors</i> for modeling individual doctors
  in the design model <i>Medical-Department-1c</i>.</p><p>Since we abstract
  away from individual patients, we rename <i>patient arrival</i> events to
  <i>NewCase</i> events, each of them representing a new case for an
  examination to be planned and performed.</p><p>The event type <i>NewCase</i>
  is a type of exogenous events,<a class="role-index-term">exogenous event</a>
  which are not caused by any causal regularity of the system under
  investigation and, therefore, have to be modeled with a recurrence<a
  class="role-index-term">recurrence</a> function that allows to compute the
  time of the next occurrence of an event of that
  type.</p><section><h4>1.2.1. Design models based on the basic conceptual
  model</h4><p>We model the random variations of two variables, the recurrence
  of new cases and the duration of examinations, in the form of random
  variables<a class="role-index-term">random variable</a> as special
  class-level ("static") functions, with a stereotype «rv», in the class to
  which they belong, as shown in the diagrams below.</p><p>The recurrence of
  <i>NewCase</i> events is modeled as a random variable with an exponential
  distribution having an event rate of 0.7 per minute. The duration of
  examinations is modeled as a random variable with a uniform distribution
  having lower bound 5 and upper bound 9.</p><section><h5>The
  Medical-Department-1a design model</h5><p>In the <a
  href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core2/Medical-Department-1a/index.html">Medical-Department-1a</a>
  information design model, instead of using the built-in generic resource
  management logic, we explicitly model the resource management of doctors
  with the help of a counter variable for available doctors in the form of an
  attribute <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i>, and the operations
  <i>isDoctorAvailable()</i>, <i>allocateDoctor()</i> and
  <i>releaseDoctor()</i>, in the <i>MedicalDepartment</i>
  class:</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="../img/MedDep_CIM1-IDM1a.svg"
  width="500" /></div></figure><p>The <i>isDoctorAvailable</i> function simply
  tests if <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i> &gt; 0, while the procedures
  <i>allocateDoctor</i> and <i>releaseDoctor</i> decrement and increment the
  <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i> counter.</p><p>In addition to an information
  design model for defining the simulation's state structure, we also need to
  make a process design model for defining the dynamics of the simulation. The
  following DPMN process diagram defines two event rules:</p><figure><div><img
  src="../img/MedDep_CPM1-PDM1a.svg" /></div></figure><p>Notice that this
  process design model contains the entire resource management logic for
  (de-)allocating doctors to (from) examinations. Since standard resource
  management procedures can be defined in a generic way, this logic (and the
  related code) can be moved from example models to the simulator, as
  explained in the next section.</p><p>The following table shows the two event
  rules defined by the above DPMN diagram, expressed in pseudo-code.</p><table
      border="1" style="border-spacing:3px;width:100%;">

  Medical-Department-1b design model</h5><p>In the <a
  href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core2/Medical-Department-1b/index.html">Medical-Department-1b</a>
  <em>information design</em> model we make two simplifications: </p><ol>
      <li>We drop the object type <i>MedicalDepartment</i>; since we only need
      to model one medical department as the process owner, we can leave it
      implicit. This is a general pattern: whenever there is only one process
      owner, we can leave it implicit.</li>

      <li>Since we now use the generic resource management logic that is built
      into <em>OES Core 2</em>, we do not need to model the methods
      <i>isDoctorAvailable</i>, <i>allocateDoctor</i> and
      <i>releaseDoctor</i>. Instead, we define a resource role doctor (with
      resource cardinality 1) for the activity type <i>Examination</i>.</li>
    </ol><p>The resulting information design model only includes two classes:
  the event type <i>NewCase</i> and the activity type <i>Examination</i>, as
  shown on the left-hand side of the following class
  diagram.</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="../img/MedDep_CIM1-IDM1b.svg"
  width="650" /></div></figure><p>On the right-hand side bottom of this
  diagram, the resource role <i>doctor</i> and its count pool <i>doctors</i>,
  instantiating the <em>OES Core 2</em> library classes <i>ResourceRole</i>
  and <i>CountPool</i> (as a special type of <i>ResourcePool)</i>, are shown.
  Notice that <u>resourceRole</u> assigns the OES resource role <i>doctor</i>
  with resource cardinality 1 to the activity type <i>Examination</i><span
  class="role-footnote">Such a resource role assignment is expressed in the
  UML class diagram as a link instantiating the corresponding class-level
  meta-property <i>ActivityType.resourceRole</i>.</span>, which is in turn
  linked to a count pool with name <i>doctors</i>. In OESjs-Core2, this is
  coded in the file <kbd>Examination.js</kbd> in the following way: </p><pre>class <b>Examination</b> extends aCTIVITY {
  constructor({id, startTime, duration}={}) {
    super({id, startTime, duration});
  }
  static <b>duration</b>() {return rand.uniform( 5, 10);}
}
Examination.<b>resourceRoles</b> = {
  "doctor": {card:1}
}
</pre><p>The generic class-level ("static") property
  <i>Examination.plannedActivities</i> is automatically created by the
  simulator. Likewise, the count pool "doctors" is automatically created and
  assigned to the resource role definition map entry
  <i>Examination.resourceRoles["doctor"]</i>. </p><p>In the
  Medical-Department-1b <em>process design</em> model we make corresponding
  simplifications as in the information design model above:</p><ol>
      <li>Leaving the process owner implicit, we drop the process owner
      rectangle <i>MedicalDepartment</i>.</li>

      <li>Since we use the generic resource management logic that is built
      into <em>OES Core 2</em> by means of <em>Resource-Dependent Activity
      Start</em> arrows, we do not need any resource management code involving
      the methods <i>isDoctorAvailable</i>, <i>allocateDoctor</i> and
      <i>releaseDoctor</i> in event rules. Since the event rules of the
      Medical-Department-1a model have only be concerned with resource
      management, we can discard them altogether.</li>
    </ol><p>In the resulting DPMN diagram, the event type <i>NewCase</i> is
  connected to the activity type <i>Examination</i> with a
  <em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em> arrow:</p><figure><div><img
  src="../img/MedDep_CPM1-PDM1b.svg" width="300" /></div></figure><p>Using a
  <em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em> arrow from <i>NewCase</i> to
  <i>Examination</i> implies that upon a <i>NewCase</i> event a new planned
  <i>Examination</i> activity is enqueued by the simulator, if the required
  resources are not available; otherwise, a new <i>Examination</i> activity is
  scheduled to start immediately. Using this built-in standard resource
  management logic relieves the simulation developer from coding the resource
  availability tests and the enqueuing of a new <i>Examination</i> activity in
  a <i>NewCase</i> event rule.</p><p>Since in this model, <i>NewCase</i>
  events and <i>Examination</i> activities are handled according to the
  generic logic of <i>Activity Networks</i> built into the <em>OES Core 2</em>
  simulator, we do not need to model/specify any event rules. For having
  <i>NewCase</i> events succeeded by <i>Examination</i> activities, we just
  need to specify this event flow relationship (in OESjs-Core2) in the
  following way:</p><pre>NewCase.<b>successorActivity</b> = "Examination";</pre><p>The
  simulator interprets this <i>successorActivity</i> assignment when creating
  follow-up events for <i>NewCase</i> events by enqueuing a planned
  examination activity in the following way </p><pre>Examination.<b>plannedActivities</b>.<b>enqueue</b>( new Examination())</pre></section><section><h5>The
  Medical-Department-1c design model</h5><p>In the <a
  href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core2/Medical-Department-1c/index.html">Medical-Department-1c</a>
  design model, the resource pool <i>doctors</i> is modeled as an individual
  resource pool instead of a count pool. This allows making the model more
  realistic, for instance, by assigning an individual work schedule to each
  doctor defining her availability.</p><p>Compared to the
  Medical-Department-1b information design model, we have to change the
  following: </p><ol>
      <li>We need to define an object type <i>Doctor</i> having a resource
      <i>status</i> attribute with the four possible values AVAILABLE, BUSY,
      OUT_OF_ORDER or OUT_OF_DUTY.</li>

      <li>While we keep the <u>resourceRole</u> link with the definition of
      the resource role <i>doctor</i> (with resource cardinality 1), we
      replace the count pool linked to it with an individual resource
      pool.</li>
    </ol><p>The resulting information design model is shown in the following
  class diagram:</p><figure><div><img alt="???"
  src="../img/MedDep_CIM1-IDM1c.svg" width="600" /></div></figure><p>On the
  right-hand side bottom of this diagram, the resource role <i>doctor</i> and
  its individual pool <i>doctors</i>, instantiating the <em>OES Core 2</em>
  library classes <i>ResourceRole</i> and <i>IndividualPool</i> (as a special
  type of <i>ResourcePool)</i>, are shown. In OESjs-Core2, this is coded in
  the file <kbd>Examination.js</kbd> in the following way: </p><pre>Examination.<b>resourceRoles</b> = {
  "doctor": {<b>range</b>: Doctor, card:1}
}</pre><p>The Medical-Department-1c <em>process design</em> model is the same
  as in the Medical-Department-1b process design model
  above:</p><figure><div><img src="../img/MedDep_CPM1-PDM1b.svg"
  width="300" /></div></figure></section></section><section

  conceptual model</h4><p>In the <a
  href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core2/Medical-Department-2/index.html">Medical-Department-2</a>
  design model, we model two activity types: <i>WalkToRoom</i> activities
  involve a <i>room</i> and are performed by a <i>nurse</i>, while
  <i>Examination</i> activities involve a <i>room</i> and are performed by a
  <i>doctor</i>. The resource pools <i>nurses</i> and <i>doctors</i> are
  modeled as individual resource pools, while the resource pool <i>rooms</i>,
  which is used by both <i>WalkToRoom</i> and <i>Examination</i> activities,
  is modeled as a count pool. </p><p>The resulting information design model is

  that the generic class-level ("static") properties
  <i>WalkToRoom.plannedActivities</i> and <i>Examination.plannedActivities</i>
  don't have to be defined when coding the two activity types since they are
  automatically created by the simulator.</p>In the process design model,
  again, we leave the process owner implicit, not showing a container
  rectangle for <i>MedicalDepartment:</i><figure><div><img

  <em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em> arrows between <i>NewCase</i> and
  <i>WalkToRoom</i>, as well as between <i>WalkToRoom</i> and
  <i>Examination</i> are coded as</p><pre>NewCase.<b>successorActivity</b> = "WalkToRoom";</pre><p>in
  <kbd>NewCase.js</kbd>, and as </p><pre>WalkToRoom.<b>successorActivity</b> = "Examination";</pre><p>in
