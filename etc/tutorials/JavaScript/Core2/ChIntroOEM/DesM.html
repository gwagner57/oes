    <title>Making a Simulation Design Model</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>When making a simulation design based on the conceptual model of
  the system under investigation, we may abstract away from certain items of
  the conceptual model for obtaining a sufficiently simple design. The right
  degree of abstraction depends on the purpose of the model.</p><p>In our
  example, the purpose of the simulation model is to compute the <em>maximum
  queue length</em> and the <em>utilization</em> of doctors. So, we may
  abstract away from the object type <em>patients</em> since we don't need any
  information about individual patients. If we don't need utilization
  statistics per doctor, but only the average utilization of all doctors, then
  we may also abstract away from the object type <i>doctors</i> This is the
  approach chosen in our <i>Medical-Department-0</i> design model, while we
  keep the object type <i>doctors</i> for modeling individual doctors in the
  <i>Medical-Department-1</i> design model.</p><p>Since we abstract away from
  individual patients, we rename <i>patient arrival</i> events to
  <i>NewCase</i> events, each of them representing a new case for an
  examination to be planned and performed.</p><p>The event type <i>NewCase</i>
  is a type of exogenous events,<a class="role-index-term">exogenous event</a>
  which are not caused by any causal regularity of the system under
  investigation and, therefore, have to be modeled with a recurrence<a
  class="role-index-term">recurrence</a> function that allows to compute the
  time of the next occurrence of an event of that type.</p><p>We also model
  the random variations of two variables, the recurrence of new cases and the
  duration of examinations, in the form of random variables<a
  class="role-index-term">random variable</a> as special class-level
  ("static") operations, with a stereotype «rv», in the class to which they
  belong, as shown in the diagrams below.</p><p>The recurrence of
  <i>NewCase</i> events is modeled as a random variable with an exponential
  distribution having an event rate of 0.7 per minute. The duration of
  examinations is modeled as a random variable with a uniform distribution
  having lower bound 5 and upper bound 9.</p><section><h4>1.2.1. The
  Medical-Department-0 design model</h4><p>In the <a
  href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core2/Medical-Department-0/index.html">Medical-Department-0</a>
  information design model, we explicitly model the resource management of
  doctors with the help of a counter variable for available doctors in the
  form of an attribute <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i>, and the operations
  <i>isDoctorAvailable()</i>, <i>allocateDoctor()</i> and
  <i>releaseDoctor()</i>, in the <i>MedicalDepartment</i>
  class:</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="../img/MedExam_CIM1-IDM0.svg"
  width="400" /></div></figure><p>The <i>isDoctorAvailable</i> function simply
  tests if <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i> &gt; 0, while the procedures
  <i>allocateDoctor</i> and <i>releaseDoctor</i> decrement and increment the
  <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i> counter.</p><p>In addition to an information
  design model for defining the simulation system's state structure, we also
  need to make a process design model for defining the dynamics of the
  simulation system.</p><figure><figcaption>A process design model in the form
  of a DPMN Process Diagram</figcaption><div><img
  src="../img/MedDep_CPM1-PDM0.svg" /></div></figure><p>Notice that this
  process design model contains the entire resource management logic for
  (de-)allocating doctors to (from) examinations. Since resource management
  can be defined in a generic way, this logic can be moved from the example
  model to the simulator, as explained in the next section.</p><p>The
  following table shows the two event rules defined by the above DPMN Process
  Diagram, expressed in pseudo-code.</p><table border="1"

  model</h4><p>In the <a
  href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core2/Medical-Department-1/index.html">Medical-Department-1</a>
  design model we make two simplifications: </p><ol>
      <li>We drop the object type <i>MedicalDepartment</i>; since we only need
      to model one medical department as the process owner, we can leave it
      implicit. This is a general pattern: whenever there is only one process
      owner, we can leave it implicit.</li>

      <li>We use the generic resource management logic that is built into OES
      Core 2, which relieves us from coding it ourselves.</li>
    </ol><p>The resulting design information model only includes two classes:
  the event type <i>NewCase</i> and the activity type <i>Examination</i>, as
  shown on the left-hand side of the following class
  diagram.</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="../img/MedExam_CIM1-IDM1.svg"
  width="600" /></div></figure><p>The right-hand side of this diagram shows
  resource role "doctor" and its count pool "doctors", which instantiate the
  OES Core 2 library classes <i>ResourceRole</i> and <i>CountPool</i>, which
  specializes <i>ResourcePool</i>.</p><p>In the process design model, we can
  use a <em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em> arrow, which implies the
  generic resource management logic of OES Core 2:</p><figure><div><img
  src="../img/MedDep_CPM1-PDM1.svg" width="300" /></div></figure><p>The
  following table shows the event rules defined by the DPMN process diagram,
  which now account for the fact that both types of events occur at a
  particular service desk that is referenced by the event expression parameter
  <i>sd</i>.</p><table border="1" style="border-spacing:3px;width:100%;">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>ON (event type)</b></p></td>

          <td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>DO (event routine)</b></p></td>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><p>NewCase @ t<br /></p></td>

          <td><pre>Examination.plannedActivities.enqueue( new Examination())</pre></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table><p>For the activity type <i>Examination</i>, we do not need an
  event rule, since it is handled according to the implicit generic
  resource-dependent activity start logic.</p></section></body>
