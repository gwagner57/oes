  pizza service company takes phone orders for making and delivering pizzas,

  delivery scooter drivers. From time to time the order takers cannot cope

  <em>take order</em> activities are performed by an <em>order taker</em>,
  <em>make pizza</em> activities require both an <em>oven</em> and a <em>pizza
  maker</em>. Finally, <i><em>deliver</em> pizza</i> activities require a
  delivery staff member and a scooter.</p><details><summary>Conceptual

      <li>pizza making (performed by pizza makers using ovens),</li>

      <li>pizza delivery (performed by delivery staff using scooters).</li>
    </ol><p>Object, event and activity types, together with their
  participation associations, can be visually described in a conceptual
  information model in the form of a special kind of UML class diagram, called
  Object Event (<abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr>) class diagram, as shown
  below.</p><figure><img

  annotations «rr» and «rp» denote <em>resource roles</em> and <em>resource
  pools</em>. For instance, the activity type <i>make pizza</i> has two
  resource roles, <i>pizza maker</i>s and <i>oven</i>. A pizza service company
  has resource pools for order takers, pizza makers, ovens, delivery scooter
  drivers and scooters. </p><p>Resource roles have resource cardinality

  <i>oven</i>), resource role types (like <i>ovens</i>) and resource

  </p><p>An organization defines <em>organizational positions</em>, which are
  filled by human resources. Each organizational position is characterized by
  a set of human resource roles to be played by position holders. In the Pizza
  Service organization, there are three positions: order takers, pizza makers
  and delivery scooter drivers.</p><blockquote

  instead of "objects, immediate events and

  open="open"><summary>Conceptual Process Model</summary><p>The following BPMN
  diagram shows a conceptual process model of the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza
  business process, with three swimlanes for the three performers of the
  process:</p><figure><img
  alt="A conceptual process model in the form of a BPMN diagram"
  src="../img/Pizzeria_CPM_BPMN.svg" width="600" /></figure><p>Notice the BPMN
  Boundary Timeout Event circle attached to the <i>take order</i> activity
  representing timeout events that cancel the activity. They are supposed to
  model the <em>reneging</em> behavior of waiting customers loosing their
  patience and hanging up the phone without placing an order. However, BPMN
  does not allow restricting such a timeout mechanism to the waiting phase of
  a planned activity, that is the time span during which the planned activity
  has been enqueued, but not yet started. Rather, it applies to the entire
  cycle time of <i>take order</i> activities, which means that also started
  activities, where the order taker is already listening to the customer, may
  be canceled due to reneging.</p><p>While BPMN allows modeling the performers
  of activities with swimlanes, it does not support modeling other types of
  resource objects. As a workaround, we have included the resource objects
  <i>oven</i>s and <i>scooter</i>s in the form of BPMN Data Objects.</p><p>The
  third, and most severe, issue of the BPMN model is its uniform (semantically
  overloaded) use of "sequence flow" arrows for sequencing events and
  activities. While in the case of all three activities, incoming "sequence
  flow" arrows do not mean that an activity is started, but rather that a new
  planned activity is enqueued (and only started when all required resources
  become available), in the case of the event <i>lost order</i>, the incoming
  "sequence flow" arrow means that a new event is scheduled to occur
  immediately.</p><p>These three issues of BPMN have been solved in DPMN,
  where <em>resource-dependent activity start arrows</em> are distinguished
  from <em>event scheduling arrows</em>, as shown in the following DPMN
  process diagram:</p><figure><img
  alt="A conceptual process model in the form of a DPMN diagram"
  src="../img/Pizzeria_CPM.svg" width="550" /></figure><p>Notice how the
  timeout event circle (with a clock icon) is attached to the three bars of
  the resource-dependent activity start arrow representing the queue of
  planned order taking activities waiting for the availability of an order
  taker. This implies that the timeout applies to the waiting phase, and not
  to the order taking activity.</p><p>A conceptual <abbr
  title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process diagram
  does normally not include any element representing a resource pool. Yet, it
  may display the performer roles of activity types, like <i>order taker</i>
  and <i>pizza maker </i> in the diagram above. It is assumed that for any
  organizational position described in the underlying <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class model, the organization under
  consideration has a corresponding resource
  pool.</p></details></details><details><summary>Simulation
  Design</summary><p>In our simulation design, we make the following
  simplifications. We consider only one particular pizza service company,
  which does not have to be modeled as an explicit object. Also, we abstract
  away from individual customers, orders and pizzas. And we merge the resource
  roles <i>delivery scooter driver</i> and <i>scooter</i>, keeping only
  <i>scooter</i>s as resources of <i>deliver pizza</i> activities.</p><p>We
  consider a scenario with two order takers, ten pizza makers, five ovens and
  20 scooters.</p><details open="open"><summary>Information Design
  Model</summary><p>An information design model, in the form of an <abbr

      <li>Abstracting away from items that are not design-relevant.</li>

      <li>Adding properties,functions and methods to object, event and
      activity classes. In particular, a <i>status</i> attribute is added to
      all resource object types, such as <i>OrderTaker</i> and <i>Oven</i>,
      and a class-level <i>duration</i> function is added to all activity
      classes.</li>
    </ol><figure><figcaption>An information design model defining object,
  event and activity types.</figcaption><img alt="???"
  src="../img/Pizzeria_IDMa.svg" width="600" /></figure><p>Notice how
  functions representing random variables, like the <code>duration</code>
  function of all activity types, are marked with the keyword (or UML
  'stereotype') «rv» standing for "random variable". These random variable
  functions sample from a probability distribution function (PDF), which is
  symbolically indicated with expressions like <i>Tri(30,50,40)</i> standing
  for the <em>triangular</em> PDF with lower and upper bounds 30 and 50, and a
  median of 40. </p><p>The activity type <i>TakeOrder</i> is associated with
  the object type <i>OrderTaker</i> via the implicit resource role
  <i>orderTaker</i> (with a resource cardinality constraint of "exactly 1"),
  indicated with the association end stereotype «rr» standing for "resource
  role". A resource role assigns resource objects to activities.
  </p><p>Likewise, <i>MakePizza</i> is associated with <i>PizzaMaker</i> and
  <i>Oven</i> as its resource roles, where the implicit <i>pizzaMakers</i>
  resource role has a resource cardinality constraint of "exactly 2" and the
  <i>oven</i> resource role has a resource cardinality constraint of "exactly
  1".</p><p>An <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design diagram like
  the one above, defines resource roles (like <i>pizzaMakers</i>), resource
  role types (like <i>PizzaMaker</i>) and resource cardinality constraints
  (like "exactly 2") for all types of activities. Normally, in an <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> simulation there is a one-to-one
  correspondence between resource role types and resource pools. By
  convention, a resource pool has the same name as the corresponding resource
  role type, yet pluralized and starting with a lowercase character. For
  instance, the name of the resource pool for <i>PizzaMaker</i> is
  <i>pizzaMakers</i>.</p><p>Notice that <i>OrderCall</i> events are exogenous,
  having a recurrence function defined case-wise for each of the five hours
  per day operation of the pizza service company (in the attached invariant
  box).</p>For implementing the waiting timeout event defined in the process
  model, the activity type <i>TakeOrder</i> has a class-level
  <i>waitingTimeout</i> function implementing a random variable with PDF
  <i>U(3,6)</i>.</details><details open="open"><summary>Process Design
  Model</summary><p>A process design model, in the form of a DPMN process
  diagram as shown below, is derived from a conceptual process model by
  abstracting away from items that are not design-relevant and possibly adding
  certain computational details. In the case of the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza
  business process, we can drop the lost orders event since its purpose,
  obtaining a statistics of lost orders, can be implicitly achieved by the
  waiting timeout event attached to the queue of planned <i>TakeOrder</i>
  activities.</p><figure><figcaption>A computationally complete process design

  and <i>PizzaMaker</i> in the diagram above. It is assumed that for any
  organizational position described in the underlying <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class model, the organization under
  consideration has a corresponding resource pool. By default , each resource
  role of an activity type is associated with a resource pool having the same
  (yet pluralized) name, such that its resources are instances of a
  corresponding resource role type, which is an organizational position in the
  case of human resources. </p><p>For instance, for the <i>MakePizza</i>
  activity a pool <i>ovens</i> is assigned to its resource role <i>oven</i> by
  default. The members of the pool <i>ovens</i> are instances of the
  (resource) object type <i>Oven</i>. Likewise, a pool <i>pizzaMakers</i> is
  assigned to the <i>MakePizza</i> resource role <i>pizzaMaker</i>. The
  members of this pool are instances of the organizational position
  <i>PizzaMaker</i>. These default pool assignments are normally not shown in
  a DPMN diagram, but an <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> simulator takes
  care of them.</p></details></details><details><summary>Model Variant: Orders
  May Also Be Taken by Pizza Makers</summary><p>For decreasing the number of
  lost orders due to long waiting times, it is advisable to charge pizza
  makers with taking orders whenever no order taker is available. In resource
  management terminology, the organizational position <i>pizza maker</i> is
  redefined by adding the resource role <i>order taker</i> to its portfolio of
  organizational roles. </p><p>In a conceptual <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class diagram, this can be expressed by
  adding a subtyping arrow from <i>pizza makers</i> to <i>order takers</i>
  categorized as an <em><b>alternative resource subtyping</b></em> arrow with
  the stereotype «ar», as shown in the following diagram:</p><figure><img
  alt="conceptual information model describing object, event and activity types"

  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design diagram is extended in the same
  way, by adding an <em>alternative resource subtyping</em> arrow from
  <i>PizzaMaker</i> to <i>OrderTaker</i>.</p><p>The DPMN process design model
  is not affected by this change.</p></details><details
  open="open"><summary>Implementation with OESjs-Core2</summary><p>The
  JavaScript-based simulator OESjs-Core2 implements the <em>Object Event
  Simulation (OES)</em> paradigm, and, consequently, allows a straight-forward
  coding of <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class models and <abbr
  title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process
  models.</p><details><summary>Implementing the Information Design
  Model</summary><p>For implementing the <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr>
  class design model with OESjs-Core2, we have to code all object types, event
  types and activity types specified in the model in the form of JavaScript
  classes. We start with the object type <i>OrderTaker</i> shown in the
  following diagram:</p><figure class="right"><img alt="???"
  src="../img/Pizzeria-OrderTaker_IDM.svg" width="200" /></figure><p>The
  <code>OrderTaker</code> object class can be coded in the following
  way:</p><pre>class <b>OrderTaker</b> extends oBJECT {
  constructor({ id, name, status}) {
    super( id, name);
    this.status = status;
  }
}</pre><p>All object classes inherit an <code>id</code> attribute and a
  <code>name</code> attribute from the pre-defined <abbr
  title="Object Event Simulation">OES</abbr> foundation class
  <code>oBJECT</code>. Since order takers are resource objects, we need to
  define a <code>status</code> property for them. </p><p>The other object
  classes (<i>PizzaMaker</i>, <i>Oven</i> and <i>Scooter</i>) are coded in the
  same way.</p><p>We next show how to code the event type <i>OrderCall</i>
  depicted in the following diagram:</p><figure class="right"><img alt="???"
  src="../img/Pizzeria-OrderCall_IDM.svg" width="250" /></figure><p>The
  <code>OrderCall</code> event class is coded in the following way:</p><pre>class <b>OrderCall</b> extends eVENT {
  constructor({ occTime, delay}) {
    super({occTime, delay});
  }
  <b>createNextEvent</b>() {
    return new OrderCall({delay: OrderCall.recurrence()});
  }
  static <b>recurrence</b>() {
    var hour = Math.floor(sim.time / 60);
    return rand.exponential( OrderCall.arrivalRates[hour]);
  }
}
// arrival rates per minute (for a daily operation for 5 hours)
OrderCall.<b>arrivalRates</b> = [1/6, 1/0.66, 1/1.5, 1/6, 1/12];</pre><p>All
  event classes inherit an <code>occTime</code> attribute and a
  <code>delay</code> attribute from the pre-defined <abbr
  title="Object Event Simulation">OES</abbr> foundation class
  <code>eVENT</code>. Any event in <abbr
  title="Object Event Simulation">OES</abbr> can be created either with a
  value for the attribute <code>occTime</code> (standing for <em>occurrence
  time</em>) or with a value for the attribute <code>delay</code>. In the
  latter case, the event's occurrence time is automatically derived by adding
  the value of <code>delay</code> to the current simulation time.
  </p><p>Finally, we show how to code the activity type <i>TakeOrder</i>
  depicted in the following diagram:</p><figure class="right"><img alt="???"
  src="../img/Pizzeria-TakeOrder_IDM.svg" width="400" /></figure><p>The
  <i>TakeOrder</i> activity class is coded in the following way:</p><pre>class <b>TakeOrder</b> extends aCTIVITY {
  constructor({id, startTime, duration}={}) {
    super({id, startTime, duration});
  }
  static <b>duration</b>() {
    return rand.uniform( 1, 4);
  }
  static <b>waitingTimeout</b>() {
    return rand.uniformInt( 3, 6);
  }
}
TakeOrder.<b>resourceRoles</b> = {
  "orderTaker": {range: OrderTaker}
}</pre><p>All activity classes inherit the attributes <code>id</code>,
  <code>startTime</code> and <code>duration</code> from the pre-defined <abbr
  title="Object Event Simulation">OES</abbr> foundation class
  <code>aCTIVITY</code>. When an activity is created as a JS object during a
  simulation run, the value of its <code>duration</code> property is obtained
  by invoking the <code>duration()</code> function defined as a class-level
  ("static") function for its activity class. These activity duration
  functions typically implement a random variable by invoking a random variate
  sampling function, such as <code>rand.triangular(30,50,40)</code>, which
  samples from the triangular probability distribution function (with
  min/max=30/50 and mode=40).</p><p>Notice how the resource role association
  between <i>TakeOrder</i> and <i>OrderTaker</i>, which defines the resource
  reference property <i>TakeOrder::orderTaker</i>, is coded by a corresponding
  entry in the map-valued class-level property
  <code>resourceRoles</code>.</p></details><details><summary>Implementing the
  Process Design Model</summary><p><b>T.B.D. The following material has been
  copied from the Load-Haul-Dump model</b></p><p>A DPMN process design model
  can be decomposed into a set of event rule design models, one for each type
  of event specified in the design model. Starting with the
  <code>HaulRequest</code> event rule design model, we show how the event
  rules specified by each of these event rule design models can be coded in
  the form of an <code>onEvent</code> method.</p><figure><figcaption>A design
  model for the <code>HaulRequest</code> event rule.</figcaption><img
  alt="???" src="../img/LoadHaulDump-HaulRequest_RDM.svg"
  width="400" /></figure><p>In the following <code>HaulRequest</code> event
  rule method <code>onEvent</code>, all available trucks are allocated to the
  current haul request, and, after computing the number of loads, for each of
  the allocated trucks a new <code>GoToLoadingSite</code> activity is
  started:</p><pre>class <b>HaulRequest</b> extends eVENT {
  ...
  <b>onEvent</b>() {
    const followupEvents=[],
          allocatedTrucks = sim.resourcePools["trucks"].<b>allocateAll</b>();
    // assign model variable
    sim.model.v.<b>nmrOfLoads</b> = Math.ceil( this.quantity / Truck.capacity);
    for (const t of allocatedTrucks) {
      const goActy = <b>new GoToLoadingSite</b>();
      // assign truck as required resource
      goActy.truck = t;
      // start GoToLoadingSite activity
      followupEvents.push( <b>new aCTIVITYsTART</b>({plannedActivity: goActy}));
    }
    return followupEvents;
  }
}</pre><p>Since activities are composite events, we also have event rules for
  them. The following <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> event rule is triggered whenever
  a <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> activity is completed, since the completion of an
  activity counts as its occurrence event.</p><figure><figcaption>A design
  model for the <code>GoToLoadingSite</code> event rule.</figcaption><img
  alt="???" src="../img/LoadHaulDump-GoToLoadingSite_RDM.svg"
  width="300" /></figure><p>This rule states that whenever a
  <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> activity ends (or is completed), then a new planned
  <i>Load</i> activity is enqueued, if no wheel loader is available, or,
  otherwise, a new <i>Load</i> activity is started. In OESjs, it is coded in
  the following declarative way: </p><pre>GoToLoadingSite.<b>successorActivity</b> = "Load"</pre><p>Such
  a successor activity assignment allows the simulator to check if the
  required resources are available and then start the successor activity, or,
  otherwise, enqueue a new planned successor
  activity.</p><figure><figcaption>A design model for the <code>Load</code>
  event rule.</figcaption><img alt="???"
  src="../img/LoadHaulDump-Load_RDM.svg" width="300" /></figure><p>This rule
  states that whenever a <i>Load</i> activity ends, the model variable
  <i>nmrOfLoads</i> is decremented by 1, and a <i>Haul</i> activity is
  immediately started (as a successor activity). Since the <i>Haul</i>
  activity doesn't require any additional resources, there is no need to
  enqueue a planned activity and wait for the availability of resources. In
  OESjs, this rule is coded in the following way:</p><pre>class <b>Load</b> extends aCTIVITY {
  ...
  <b>onActivityEnd</b>() {
    const followupEvents = [];
    // decrement nmrOfLoads counter
    sim.model.v.nmrOfLoads--;
    return followupEvents;
  }
  ...
}
Load.<b>successorActivity</b> = "Haul";</pre><p>Notice that the state change
  expressed in the <i>modelVariables</i> object rectangle, the decrementation
  of <i>nmrOfLoads</i>, is taken care of in the <code>onActivityEnd</code>
  method of the <code>Load</code> activity class. Instead of explicitly
  scheduling the start of the succeeding <code>Haul</code> activity in that
  method, we simply define <code>Haul</code> to be the successor activity of
  <code>Load</code>.</p><figure><figcaption>A design model for the
  <code>Haul</code> event rule.</figcaption><img alt="???"

  is immediately succeeded by a <i>Dump</i> activity. It is coded in the
  following way:</p><pre>Haul.<b>successorActivity</b> = "Dump";</pre><figure><figcaption>A
  design model for the <code>Dump</code> event rule.</figcaption><img

  <i>Dump</i> activity ends and the model variable <i>nmrOfLoads</i> has the
  value 0, it is immediately succeeded by a <i>GoHome</i> activity, otherwise
  it is immediately succeeded by a <i>GoBackToLoadingSite</i> activity. The
  rule is coded by defining the successor activity as a function returning
  either "GoBackToLoadingSite" or "GoHome" in the following way:</p><pre>Dump.<b>successorActivity</b> = function () {
  return sim.model.v.nmrOfLoads === 0 ? "GoHome":"GoBackToLoadingSite";

  that when a <i>GoBackToLoadingSite</i> activity ends and the model variable
  <i>nmrOfLoads</i> still has a value greater than 0, a new planned
  <i>Load</i> activity is enqueued; otherwise a <i>GoHome</i> activity is
  immediately started. The rule is coded by defining the successor activity of
  <i>GoBackToLoadingSite</i> as a function returning either "Load" or "GoHome"

  having the field <i>"Arrivals defined by"</i> set to "Calls of inject()
  function", which means that, for creating 5 trucks arriving at
  <i>truckEntry</i>, the inject function needs to be invoked in the <i>"On
  startup"</i> procedure of <i>Main</i> in the following way:
  <code>truckEntry.inject(5)</code>.</p><p>For simplicity, the
  <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> activity of the DPMN model is
  discarded.</p><figure><figcaption>An AnyLogic process diagram for the

  is implemented as a <i>Service</i> element with a <i>"Delay time"</i> of
  "uniform(10,20)" and the field <i>"Resource pool"</i> set to "wheelLoaders"
  with <i>"number of units"</i> set to 1.</p><p>All other activity types are
  implemented as <i>Delay</i> elements (with a <i>"Delay time"</i> provided by
  their <i>duration</i> function defined in the class model).</p><p>The two
  decision diamonds of the DPMN model are implemented with corresponding
  <i>"SelectOutput"</i> elements called "test_if_job_done_1" and

  class="role-attention"><p>Unfortunately, PN modeling tools, like AnyLogic,
  do not support the general concept of activities (and Activity Networks),
  but only the special concept of <em>processing activities</em>. A processing
  activity has a <em>processing object</em> ("entity") as a mandatory
  participant, in addition to resource objects. While in a PN model,
  processing nodes do have a location and a <em>processing capacity</em> (the
  number of processing objects that can be processed in parallel), the nodes
  of an Activity Network (like the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza model), representing
  pure activities, in general do neither have a processing capacity nor a
  location.</p><p>For instance, in the AnyLogic Load-Haul-Dump model above,
  trucks are processing objects and the processing activity <i>Load</i> is
  performed at the processing node <i>Load</i> by a wheel loader that is
  processing a truck. Consequently, the <i>Load</i>, <i>Haul</i>, <i>Dump</i>
  and <i>GoBack</i> elements in the AnyLogic process diagram do not represent
  activities, but rather processing nodes.
