  pizza service company takes phone orders for making and delivering pizzas,
  with the help of order takers, pizza makers, ovens and a crew of pizza
  delivery scooter drivers. From time to time the order takers cannot cope
  with the number of incoming calls, and then customers grow impatient and
  hang up the phone without placing an order.</p><p>For getting a quick
  impression, you can <a

  code</a>. </p><p>Since there is a high number of lost orders due to long

  class="role-note"><p>Our <em>Make-and-Deliver-Pizza</em> modeling problem is
  based on the chapter "Example Model 3: Pizzeria operation" in the book <a

  pizza service company has resource pools for order takers, pizza makers,
  pizza ovens, delivery staff and scooters. While <em>take order</em>
  activities are performed by an <em>order taker</em>, <em>make pizza</em>
  activities require both an <em>oven</em> and a <em>pizza maker</em>.
  Finally, <i><em>deliver</em> pizza</i> activities require a delivery staff
  member and a scooter.</p><details><summary>Conceptual Information
  Model</summary><p>The potentially relevant object types are:</p><ol>
      <li>pizza service company,</li>

      <li>customers,</li>

      <li>orders,</li>

      <li>pizzas,</li>

      <li>order takers,</li>

      <li>pizza makers,</li>

      <li>pizza ovens</li>

      <li>delivery scooter drivers,</li>

      <li>scooters.</li>
    </ol><p>Potentially relevant types of events and activities are:</p><ol>
      <li>pizza ordering calls coming in from customers,</li>

      <li>order taking (an activity performed by order takers),</li>

      <li>customers hanging up the phone when having to wait for too
      long,</li>

      <li>pizza making (performed by pizza makers using ovens),</li>

      <li>pizza delivery (performed by delivery staff using scooters).</li>
    </ol><p>Object, event and activity types, together with their
  participation associations, can be visually described in a conceptual
  information model in the form of a special kind of UML class diagram, called
  Object Event (<abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr>) class diagram, as shown
  below.</p><figure><img
  alt="conceptual information model describing object, event and activity types"
  src="../img/Pizzeria_CIMa.svg" width="500" /></figure><p>The association end
  annotations «rr» and «rp» denote <em>resource roles</em> and <em>resource
  pools</em>. For instance, the activity type <i>make pizza</i> has two
  resource roles, <i>pizza maker</i>s and <i>oven</i>. A pizza service company
  has resource pools for order takers, pizza makers, ovens, delivery scooter
  drivers and scooters. </p><p>Resource roles have resource cardinality
  constraints. For instance, a <i>make pizza</i> activity requires 2 pizza
  makers and 1 oven.</p><p>A conceptual <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr>
  class diagram like the one above, describes resource roles (like
  <i>oven</i>), resource role types (like <i>ovens</i>) and resource
  cardinality constraints (like "exactly 1") for all types of activities.
  </p><p>An organization defines <em>organizational positions</em>, which are
  filled by human resources. Each organizational position is characterized by
  a set of human resource roles to be played by position holders. In the Pizza
  Service organization, there are three positions: order takers, pizza makers
  and delivery scooter drivers.</p><blockquote
  class="role-attention"><p>Strictly speaking, <i>order phone calls</i> are
  immediate (zero duration) events while a <i>take order</i> activity is an
  event with a non-zero duration. For simplicity, though, we'll often say
  "events" instead of "immediate events" or "objects, events and activities"
  instead of "objects, immediate events and
  activities".</p></blockquote></details><details><summary>Conceptual Process
  Model</summary><p>The following BPMN diagram shows a conceptual process
  model of the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza business process, with three swimlanes
  for the three performers of the process:</p><figure><img
  alt="A conceptual process model in the form of a BPMN diagram"
  src="../img/Pizzeria_CPM_BPMN.svg" width="600" /></figure><p>Notice the BPMN
  Boundary Timeout Event circle attached to the <i>take order</i> activity
  representing timeout events that cancel the activity. They are supposed to
  model the <em>reneging</em> behavior of waiting customers loosing their
  patience and hanging up the phone without placing an order. However, BPMN
  does not allow restricting such a timeout mechanism to the waiting phase of
  a planned activity, that is the time span during which the planned activity
  has been enqueued, but not yet started. Rather, it applies to the entire
  cycle time of <i>take order</i> activities, which means that also started
  activities, where the order taker is already listening to the customer, may
  be canceled due to reneging.</p><p>While BPMN allows modeling the performers
  of activities with swimlanes, it does not support modeling other types of
  resource objects. As a workaround, we have included the resource objects
  <i>oven</i>s and <i>scooter</i>s in the form of BPMN Data Objects.</p><p>The
  third, and most severe, issue of the BPMN model is its uniform (semantically
  overloaded) use of "sequence flow" arrows for sequencing events and
  activities. While in the case of all three activities, incoming "sequence
  flow" arrows do not mean that an activity is started, but rather that a new
  planned activity is enqueued (and only started when all required resources
  become available), in the case of the event <i>lost order</i>, the incoming
  "sequence flow" arrow means that a new event is scheduled to occur
  immediately.</p><p>These three issues of BPMN have been solved in DPMN,
  where <em>resource-dependent activity start arrows</em> are distinguished
  from <em>event scheduling arrows</em>, as shown in the following DPMN
  process diagram:</p><figure><img
  alt="A conceptual process model in the form of a DPMN diagram"
  src="../img/Pizzeria_CPM.svg" width="550" /></figure><p>Notice how the
  timeout event circle (with a clock icon) is attached to the three bars of
  the resource-dependent activity start arrow representing the queue of
  planned order taking activities waiting for the availability of an order
  taker. This implies that the timeout applies to the waiting phase, and not
  to the order taking activity.</p><p>A conceptual <abbr
  title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process diagram
  does normally not include any element representing a resource pool. Yet, it
  may display the performer roles of activity types, like <i>order taker</i>
  and <i>pizza maker </i> in the diagram above. It is assumed that for any
  organizational position described in the underlying <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class model, the organization under
  consideration has a corresponding resource
  pool.</p></details></details><details open="open"><summary>Simulation
  Design</summary><p>In our simulation design, we make the following
  simplifications. We consider only one particular pizza service company,
  which does not have to be modeled as an explicit object. Also, we abstract
  away from individual customers, orders and pizzas. And we merge the resource
  roles <i>delivery scooter driver</i> and <i>scooter</i>, keeping only
  <i>scooter</i>s as resources of <i>deliver pizza</i> activities.</p><p>We
  consider a scenario with two order takers, ten pizza makers, five ovens and
  20 scooters.</p><details open="open"><summary>Information Design
  Model</summary><p>An information design model, in the form of an <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class diagram as shown below, is derived from
  a conceptual information model by </p><ol>
      <li>Abstracting away from items that are not design-relevant.</li>

      <li>Adding properties,functions and methods to object, event and
      activity classes. In particular, a <i>status</i> attribute is added to
      all resource object types, such as <i>OrderTaker</i> and <i>Oven</i>,
      and a class-level <i>duration</i> function is added to all activity
      classes.</li>
    </ol><figure><img alt="???" src="../img/Pizzeria_IDMa.svg"
  width="600" /><figcaption>An information design model defining object, event
  and activity types.</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how functions
  representing random variables, like the <code>duration</code> function of
  all activity types, are marked with the keyword (or UML 'stereotype') «rv»
  standing for "random variable". These random variable functions sample from
  a probability distribution function (PDF), which is symbolically indicated
  with expressions like <i>Tri(30,40,50)</i> standing for the
  <em>triangular</em> PDF with lower and upper bounds 30 and 50 and a median
  of 40, or <i>DU(1,4)</i> standing for the discrete uniform PDF with lower
  and upper bounds 3 and 6.</p><p>In the case of the event type
  <i>OrderCall</i>, the random variable function recurrence samples from an
  exponential PDF with five different event rates given for the five
  consecutive hours during which the pizza service operates.</p><p>The
  activity type <i>TakeOrder</i> is associated with the object type
  <i>OrderTaker</i> via the implicit resource role <i>orderTaker</i> (with a
  resource cardinality constraint of "exactly 1"), indicated with the
  association end stereotype «rr» standing for "resource role". A resource
  role assigns resource objects to activities. </p><p>Likewise,
  <i>MakePizza</i> is associated with <i>PizzaMaker</i> and <i>Oven</i> via
  the (implicitly named) resource roles <i>pizzaMakers</i>, having a resource
  cardinality constraint of "exactly 2", and <i>oven</i>, having a resource
  cardinality constraint of "exactly 1".</p><p>An <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design diagram like the one above,
  defines resource roles (like <i>pizzaMakers</i>), resource role types (like
  <i>PizzaMaker</i>) and resource cardinality constraints (like "exactly 2")
  for all types of activities. Normally, in an <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> simulation there is a one-to-one
  correspondence between resource role types and resource pools. By
  convention, a resource pool has the same name as the corresponding resource
  role type, yet pluralized and starting with a lowercase character. For
  instance, the name of the resource pool for <i>PizzaMaker</i> is
  <i>pizzaMakers</i>.</p><p>Notice that <i>OrderCall</i> events are exogenous,
  having a recurrence function defined case-wise for each of the five hours
  per day operation of the pizza service company (in the attached invariant
  box).</p>For implementing the waiting timeout event defined in the process
  model, the activity type <i>TakeOrder</i> has a class-level
  <i>waitingTimeout</i> function implementing a random variable with PDF
  <i>U(3,6)</i>.</details><details open="open"><summary>Process Design
  Model</summary><p>A process design model, in the form of a DPMN process
  diagram as shown below, is derived from a conceptual process model by
  abstracting away from items that are not design-relevant and possibly adding
  certain computational details. </p><p>A <abbr
  title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process design
  model essentially defines the admissible sequences of events and activities
  together with their dependencies and effects on objects, while its
  underlying <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design model defines
  the types of objects, events and activities, together with the participation
  of objects in events and activities, including the resource roles of
  activities, as well as resource cardinality constraints, parallel
  participation constraints, alternative resources, and task priorities.
  </p><figure><img src="../img/Pizzeria_PDM.svg" width="500" /><figcaption>A
  process design for the Make-and-Deliver-Pizza business
  process.</figcaption></figure><p>It is an option, though, to enrich a <abbr
  title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process design
  model by displaying more computational details, especially the recurrence of
  exogenous events, the duration of activities and the most important resource
  management features defined in the underlying <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design model, such as resource roles
  (in particular, performer roles can be displayed in the form of
  <em>Lanes</em>), resource cardinality constraints, alternative resources,
  and task priorities. </p><figure><img src="../img/Pizzeria_PDM2.svg"
  width="650" /><figcaption>A process design model enriched by resource
  management features.</figcaption></figure><p> does not include any element
  representing a resource pool. Yet, it may display the performer roles of
  activity types, like <i>OrderTaker</i> and <i>PizzaMaker</i> in the diagram
  above. It is assumed that for any organizational position described in the
  underlying <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class model, the
  organization under consideration has a corresponding resource pool. By
  default , each resource role of an activity type is associated with a
  resource pool having the same (yet pluralized) name, such that its resources
  are instances of a corresponding resource role type, which is an
  organizational position in the case of human resources. </p><p>For instance,
  for the <i>MakePizza</i> activity a pool <i>ovens</i> is assigned to its
  resource role <i>oven</i> by default. The members of the pool <i>ovens</i>
  are instances of the (resource) object type <i>Oven</i>. Likewise, a pool
  <i>pizzaMakers</i> is assigned to the <i>MakePizza</i> resource role
  <i>pizzaMaker</i>. The members of this pool are instances of the
  organizational position <i>PizzaMaker</i>. These default pool assignments
  are normally not shown in a DPMN diagram, but an <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> simulator takes care of them.</p>Combined
  with an underlying <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design model,
  a <abbr title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process
  design model provides a computationally complete specification of a
  simulation model.</details></details><details><summary>Model Variant: Orders
  May Also Be Taken by Pizza Makers</summary><p>For decreasing the number of
  lost orders due to long waiting times, it is advisable to charge pizza
  makers with taking orders whenever no order taker is available. In resource
  management terminology, the organizational position <i>pizza maker</i> is
  redefined by adding the resource role <i>order taker</i> to its portfolio of
  organizational roles. </p><p>In a conceptual <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class diagram, this can be expressed by
  adding a subtyping arrow from <i>pizza makers</i> to <i>order takers</i>
  categorized as an <em><b>alternative resource subtyping</b></em> arrow with
  the stereotype «ar», as shown in the following diagram:</p><figure><img
  alt="conceptual information model describing object, event and activity types"
  src="../img/Pizzeria_CIM1b.svg" width="500" /></figure><p>The <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design diagram is extended in the same
  way, by adding an <em>alternative resource subtyping</em> arrow from
  <i>PizzaMaker</i> to <i>OrderTaker</i>.</p><p>The DPMN process design model
  is not affected by this change.</p></details></body>
