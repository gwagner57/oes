    <title>The Load-Haul-Dump Business Process</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>A haul service company accepts requests for hauling large
  quantities of earth from a loading site to a dump site, using dump trucks
  and wheel loaders.</p><p>You can <a
  href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core2/Load-Haul-Dump-1/">run this
  model</a> from the OES GitHub website.</p><section><h4>Conceptual
  Model</h4><figure style="float:right"><div><img alt="???"
  src="../../../../../docs/img/Load-Truck-Scenario.svg"
  width="600" /></div></figure><p>A haul service company has resource pools
  for trucks and wheel loaders. While <em>go (back) to loading site</em>,
  <em>haul</em>, <em>dump</em> and <em>go home</em> activities just require a
  <em>truck</em> (or a <em>wheel loader</em>) as a resource, <em>load</em>
  activities require both a <em>truck</em> and a <em>wheel
  loader</em>.</p><h5>Conceptual Information Model</h5><p>The potentially
  relevant object types are:</p><ol>
      <li>haul service company,</li>

      <li>wheel loaders,</li>

      <li>trucks.</li>
    </ol><p>Potentially relevant types of events and activities are:</p><ol>
      <li>requests coming in from customers,</li>

      <li>going to the loading site (an activity performed by trucks and by
      wheel loaders),</li>

      <li>loading (performed by wheel loaders using trucks as resources),</li>

      <li>hauling (performed by trucks),</li>

      <li>dumping (performed by trucks),</li>

      <li>going back to loading site (performed by trucks),</li>

      <li>going home when the job is done (performed by trucks and by wheel
      loaders).</li>
    </ol><p>Both object types and event types, together with their
  participation associations, can be visually described in a conceptual
  information model in the form of a UML class diagram, as shown
  below.</p><figure><figcaption>A conceptual information model describing
  object, event and activity types.</figcaption><img alt="???"

  width="500" /></figure><p>Notice that the association end stereotypes «rr»
  and «rp» denote <em>resource roles</em> and <em>resource pools</em>. A haul
  service company has resource pools for trucks and wheel loaders. The
  activity types <em>haul</em>, <em>dump</em> and <em>go back to loading
  site</em> have a resource role <em>truck</em> for assigning a truck to any
  activity of one of those types. The activity types <em>go to loading
  site</em> and <em>go home</em> have either a a resource role <em>truck</em>
  or a resource role <em>wheel loader</em>. The activity type <em>load</em>
  has both resource role <em>truck</em> and a resource role <em>wheel
  loaders</em> for assigning at least one and at most two wheel loaders to any
  <em>load</em> activity (as indicated by the multiplicity "1..2" at the «rr»
  association end at the class <em>wheel loaders</em>).</p><h5>Conceptual
  Process Model</h5><p>The involved types of events and activities can be
  related with each other via <em>resource-dependent activity start
  arrows</em> and <em>event scheduling arrows</em>, as shown in the following
  DPMN process diagram:</p><figure><figcaption>A DPMN diagram showing a
  conceptual process model.</figcaption><img alt="???"
  src="../img/CPMa8814437953840628216_2zfrdoij.svg"
  width="600" /></figure><p>The model shows that when a load-haul-dump request
  comes in, as indicated by the double arrow, the haul service company deploys
  multiple trucks and wheel loaders to the loading site (each of them performs
  a <em>go to loading site</em> activity). Each of these activities leads to
  enqueuing a new <em>load</em> activity, as indicated by the
  <em>resource-dependent activity start arrow</em> from the <em>go to loading
  site</em> activity shape to the <em>load</em> activity shape. Such an
  enqueued (planned) activity is going to be dequeued and started as soon as
  the required resources are available. This means that as soon as a wheel
  loader is available the next <em>load</em> activity is going to be started.
  When a <em>load</em> activity is completed, a <em>haul</em> activity and
  then a <em>dump</em> activity are going to start immediately, as indicated
  by the <em>event scheduling arrows</em> between them.</p><p>A more complete
  model prevents trucks to go back to the loading site and perform a load
  activity even when the job has been completed during the go back activity
  (resulting in haul and dump activities with an empty truck). For avoiding
  this uneconomic behavior, a second decision if the job has been done needs
  to be taken after the go back activity. In addition, the model has to
  describe that wheel loaders also go home when their job has been done. This
  is shown in the following refined model:</p><figure><figcaption>A refined

  width="600" /></figure></section><section><h4>Simulation Design</h4><p>In
  our simulation design, we consider only one particular haul service company,
  which does not have to be modeled explicitly. Also, we abstract away from
  the fact that also wheel loaders have to go to, and return from, the loading
  site by assuming that they are already at the site when the dump trucks
  arrive.</p><h5>Information Design Model</h5><p>In the information design
  model, we need to define a <i>status</i> attribute for all resource object
  types, such as <i>Truck</i> and <i>WheelLoader</i>, and a duration function,
  typically representing a random variable, for each activity
  type:</p><figure><figcaption>An information design model defining object,
  event and activity types.</figcaption><img alt="???"

  width="600" /></figure><p>Notice how functions representing random
  variables, like <code>duration()</code>, are marked with the keyword (or UML
  stereotype) «rv» standing for "random variable".</p><h5>Process Design
  Model</h5><p>In the process design model, we need to specify the state
  changes caused by events (including activity start and end events) and the
  constructor arguments for scheduling follow-up events, using model variables
  (possibly referencing resource pools), as shown in the following DPMN
  diagram:</p><figure><figcaption>A computationally complete process design

  src="../img/PDM3006707569242369135_2zfqip1j.svg"
  width="700" /></figure></section><section><h4>Implementation</h4><p>We show
  how to implement the design model with (1) OESjs, (2) AnyLogic, and (3)
  Simio.</p><h5>Implementation with OESjs</h5><p>We have to define classes for
  all object, event and activity types, by extending the predefined OESjs
  classes <code>oBJECT</code>, <code>eVENT</code> and <code>aCTIVITY</code>. .
