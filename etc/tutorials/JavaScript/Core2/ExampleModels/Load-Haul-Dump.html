  Model</summary><p>A haul service company has resource pools for dump trucks
  and wheel loaders. While the activities <em>go (back) to loading site</em>,
  <em>haul</em>, <em>dump</em> and <em>go home</em> just require a
  <em>truck</em> (or a <em>wheel loader</em>) as a resource, <em>load</em>
  activities require both a <em>truck</em> and a <em>wheel
  loader</em>.</p><details open="open"><summary>Conceptual Information
  Model</summary><p>The potentially relevant object types are:</p><ol>
      <li>haul service company,</li>

      <li>wheel loaders,</li>

      <li>dump trucks.</li>
    </ol><p>Potentially relevant types of events and activities are:</p><ol>
      <li>haul requests coming in from customers,</li>

      <li>going to the loading site (an activity performed by trucks and by
      wheel loaders),</li>

      <li>loading (performed by wheel loaders using trucks as resources),</li>

      <li>hauling (performed by trucks),</li>

      <li>dumping (performed by trucks),</li>

      <li>going back to loading site (performed by trucks),</li>

      <li>going home when the job is done (performed by trucks and by wheel
      loaders).</li>
    </ol><p>Both object types and event types, together with their
  participation associations, can be visually described in a conceptual
  information model in the form of a special kind of UML class diagram, called
  Object Event (<abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr>) class diagram, as shown
  below.</p><figure><figcaption>A conceptual <abbr

  width="450" /></figure><p>Notice that the association end annotations «rr»
  and «rp» denote <em>resource roles</em> and <em>resource pools</em>. A haul
  service company has resource pools for trucks and wheel loaders. The
  activity types <em>haul</em>, <em>dump</em> and <em>go back to loading
  site</em> have a resource role <em>truck</em> for assigning a truck to any
  activity of one of those types. The activity types <em>go to loading
  site</em> and <em>go home</em> have either a a resource role <em>truck</em>
  or a resource role <em>wheel loader</em>, as indicated by the
  <em>alternative association</em> constraint expressed with a dashed line
  annotated with <em>{xor}</em>. The activity type <em>load</em> has both
  resource role <em>truck</em> and a resource role <em>wheel loaders</em> for
  assigning at least one and at most two wheel loaders to any <em>load</em>
  activity (as indicated by the multiplicity "1..2" at the «rr» association
  end at the class <em>wheel loaders</em>).</p></details><details
  open="open"><summary>Conceptual Process Model</summary><p>The involved types
  of events and activities can be related with each other via
  <em>resource-dependent activity scheduling arrows</em> and <em>event
  scheduling arrows</em>, as shown in the following DPMN process
  diagram:</p><figure><img
  alt="A DPMN diagram showing a conceptual process model"
  src="../img/LoadHaulDump_CPMa.svg" width="600" /></figure><p>Notice that
  there are three types of arrows in this DPMN diagram:</p><ol>
      <li><strong><em>Event Scheduling</em></strong> arrows, like the one
      between <em>load</em> and <em>haul</em>, have the meaning that the
      succeeding activity is started as soon as the preceding activity has
      been completed (there is no need for enqueuing a planned activity, since
      all resources required by the succeeding activity are provided by the
      preceding activity). Event Scheduling arrows are not part of BPMN,
      rather they have been proposed by Schruben (1983) for <a
      href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358460" rel="nofollow noopener"
      target="_blank">Event Graphs</a>.</li>

      <li>A <strong><em>Multiple Events Scheduling</em></strong> arrow, like
      the one between <em>requests</em> and <em>go to loading site</em>, means
      that one instance of the preceding event type triggers multiple
      instances of the succeeding event type. In our example model, this means
      that one <em>request</em> event is followed by multiple <em>go to
      loading site</em> activities, one for each truck and each wheel loader
      assigned to the job.</li>

      <li>A <strong><em>Resource-Dependent Activity Scheduling</em></strong>
      arrow, like the one between <em>go to loading site</em> and
      <em>load</em> activities, means that as soon as an activity of the
      preceding activity type has been completed, a new planned activity is
      added to the queue of planned activities of the succeeding type (and
      started as soon as all required resources are available).</li>
    </ol><p>The model shows that when a haul request comes in, the haul
  service company deploys multiple trucks and wheel loaders to the loading
  site, each of them performing a <em>go to loading site</em> activity, as
  indicated by the double arrow between the <i>haul requests</i> event circle
  and the <em>go to loading site</em> activity rectangle. Each of these
  activities leads to enqueuing a new planned <em>load</em> activity, as
  indicated by the <em>resource-dependent activity scheduling arrow</em> from
  the <em>go to loading site</em> activity shape to the <em>load</em> activity
  shape. Such an enqueued (planned) activity is going to be dequeued and
  started as soon as the required resources become available. This means that
  as soon as a wheel loader is available, the next <em>load</em> activity is
  going to be started. When a <em>load</em> activity is completed, a
  <em>haul</em> activity and then a <em>dump</em> activity are going to start
  immediately, as indicated by the <em>event scheduling arrows</em> between
  them.</p><p>A more complete model prevents trucks to go back to the loading
  site and perform a load activity even when the job has been completed during
  the go back activity (resulting in haul and dump activities with an empty
  truck). For avoiding this uneconomic behavior, a second decision if the job
  has been done needs to be taken after the go back activity. In addition, the
  model has to describe that wheel loaders also go home when their job has
  been done. This is shown in the following refined model:</p><figure><img

  refined conceptual process
  model.</figcaption></figure></details></details><details
  open="open"><summary>Simulation Design</summary><p>In our simulation design,
  we consider only one particular haul service company, which does not have to
  be modeled as an explicit object. Also, we abstract away from the fact that
  also wheel loaders have to go to, and return from, the loading site by
  assuming that they are already at the site when the dump trucks
  arrive.</p><details open="open"><summary>Information Design Model</summary>
  <p>In the information design model, we need to define a <i>status</i>
  attribute for all resource object types, such as <i>Truck</i> and
  <i>WheelLoader</i>, and a duration function, typically representing a random
  variable, for each activity type:</p><figure><figcaption
  id="figLoadHaulDumpIDM">An information design model for the Load-Haul-Dump
  system.</figcaption><img alt="???" src="../img/LoadHaulDump_IDM.svg"
  width="500" /></figure><p>Notice how functions representing random
  variables, like the <code>duration</code> function of all activity types,
  are marked with the keyword (or UML 'stereotype') «rv» standing for "random
  variable". These random variable functions sample from a probability
  distribution function (PDF), which is symbolically indicated with
  expressions like Tri(30,50,40) standing for the triangular PDF with lower
  and upper bounds 30 and 50, and a median of 40. </p><p>Each activity type is
  associated with <i>Truck</i> or <i>WheelLoader</i> as their resource
  role(s), indicated with the association end stereotype «rr» standing for
  "resource role".</p></details><details open="open"><summary>Process Design
