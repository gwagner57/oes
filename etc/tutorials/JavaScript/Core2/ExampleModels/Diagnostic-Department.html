  incoming patients first get recordings of their heart’s electrical activity
  via an Electrocardiography (ECG) and then get an ultrasound scan.</p><p>For
  getting a quick impression, you can <a
  href="https://sim4edu.com/oesjs/core2/Make-and-Deliver-Pizza-1/">run this
  model</a> from the Sim4edu website, or inspect its <a
  href="https://github.com/gwagner57/oes/tree/master/JavaScript/Core2/Make-and-Deliver-Pizza-1">OESjs
  code</a>. </p><blockquote class="role-note"><p>Our <em>Diagnostic
  Department</em> modeling problem is based on the chapter "Example Model 4:
  Clinic" in the book <a
  href="https://www.anylogic.com/resources/books/the-art-of-process-centric-modeling-with-anylogic/">The
  Art of Process-Centric Modeling with AnyLogic</a> by Arash
  Mahdavi.</p></blockquote><p>The diagnostic process consists of two
  subprocesses:</p><ol>
      <li><p>Performing the ECG: When a patient enters the clinic, they must
      wait in a waiting area for their name to be called. A patient whose name
      is called will walk to the “ECG room”, choose a free spot and wait for
      an ECG technician. ECG technicians have to walk from the “ECG technician
      room” to the “ECG Room” after being requested to a new patient. They
      will first go to the “ECG storage room", pick up an ECG machine, bring
      it to the waiting patient in the ECG room and start the ECG procedure.
      When the ECG procedure is completed, the technician returns the ECG
      machine to the storage room and walks back to the ECG technician room.
      After each procedure, ECG technicians rest for five minutes before they
      accept a new patient. A patient who has completed the ECG will not leave
      the ECG room until there is an available spot in the “ultrasound
      room”.</p></li>

      <li><p>Performing the ultrasound (US) scan: At the start of this
      procedure, a patient is done with the ECG but still waiting in the ECG
      room for a free spot in the US room. Each US spot is a combination of a
      US machine and the bed it's assigned to. When there is an available
      spot, the patient's name is called; they walk to the assigned bed and
      lay down on it. At this point, the patient is ready and a request for a
      doctor is sent to the “Doctors on Call” room. If there is no doctor
      available (that is, they are resting or with other patients), the
      patient must wait until a doctor becomes available. When an on‐call
      doctor is readily available, they will walk to the patient's bed in the
      US room and start the US scan.</p></li>
    </ol><p>The department's management has the following business objectives:
  </p><ol>
      <li>Process 50 patients during each operating day.</li>

      <li>Minimize the time to process patients (also called <em>throughput
      time</em>), as this is the most important indicator of patient
      satisfaction.</li>

      <li>Complete the ECG and US procedures for all admitted patients by the
      end of the department's daily working hours (within eight hours) and
      without the need for after-hour work.</li>
    </ol><p>The purpose of this modeling and simulation project is to find
  system designs that fulfill the above business objectives. For observing if
  a system design fulfills the objectives, we can use the following simulation
  statistics: (a) average throughput time, (b) utilization of resources, (c)
  the departure time of the last patient (used as a measure of daily operation
  duration)</p><details open="open"><summary>Conceptual Model</summary><p>The
  diagnostic department under consideration has resource pools for ECG spots,
  ECG technicians, ECG machines, US beds, US machines and doctors. While a
  <em>perform ECG</em> activity is performed by an ECG technician using an ECG
  machine and an ECG spot, a <em>perform US</em> activity requires a doctor
  using a US machine and a US bed. </p><p>For simplicity, we make a
  non-spatial (purely temporal) model, not modeling any spatial aspects, as
  opposed to the model discussed in <a

      <li>departure of patients.</li>
    </ol><p>When making a process model, we normally adopt the perspective of
  the organization (or organizational unit) that "owns" the business process
  to be modeled, here: the diagnostic department. Notice the conceptual issue
  that the activities performed by patients (walking to the ECG room, going to
  the US room) are not ordinary business activities, since they are not
  performed by an organizational actor, such as a technician or doctor,
  counting as a resource. In their case, the performer (a patient) is not a
  resource. For this reason they will be modeled without a performer
  role.</p><p>Object, event and activity types, together with their
  participation associations, can be visually described in a conceptual
  information model in the form of a conceptual Object Event (<abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr>) class diagram. The following OE class model
  describes the core elements of our diagnostic department viewed as a
  business system.</p><figure><img

  Process Model</summary><p>As service processes, health care processes can be
  viewed/modeled as Processing Networks (PNs). Since PNs are more high-level
  than Activity Networks (ANs), it is preferable to model the Diagnostic
  Department as a PN.</p><p>The following BPMN process diagram shows a
  coarse-grained conceptual process model of the primary business activities
  of the Diagnostic Department, with two swimlanes for the two performers of
  the process:</p><figure><img
  alt="A conceptual process model in the form of a BPMN diagram"
  src="../../../../../../DES-Engineering/chCaseStudies/img/DiagnDep_CPM_BPMN.svg"
  width="500" /></figure><p>Unfortunately, as an AN modeling language, BPMN
  does not provide any special elements for modeling PNs. While BPMN allows
  modeling the performers of activities with <em>lanes</em>, it does not
  support modeling other types of resource objects. As a workaround, we have
  included the resource objects <i>ECG spot</i>, <i>ECG machine</i> and <i>US
  bed</i> in the form of BPMN Data Objects. But this does not allow to clearly
  display the processing nodes of a processing network as a combination of a
  processing station (like <i>ECG spot</i>) with its processing activity (like
  <i>perform ECG</i>).</p><p>An even more severe issue of the BPMN model is
  its uniform (semantically overloaded) use of "sequence flow" arrows for
  representing different types of flows: event flows, activity flows and
  processing flows. While in the case of an activity, incoming arrows do not
  mean that an activity is started, but rather that a new <em>planned
  activity</em> (or <em>task</em>) is enqueued and only started when all
  required resources become available, in the case of a processing node, an
  incoming arrow represents a <em>processing flow</em>, which is a combined
  object-event flow of processing objects and their delayed processing
  activity start events.</p><p>These issues of BPMN have been solved in DPMN,
  which supports the visual modeling of processing networks with processing
  nodes connected by processing flow arrows, as shown in the following DPMN
  process diagram:</p><figure><img
  alt="A conceptual process model in the form of a DPMN diagram"
  src="../../../../../../DES-Engineering/chCaseStudies/img/DiagnDep_CPM_DPMN.svg"
  width="700" /></figure><p>This conceptual <abbr
  title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process diagram
  is based on the underlying <abbr title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class model
  discussed in the previous section. Notice that a two-part name of a
  processing node (like "ECG spot / perform ECG") contains both the name of
  the node's processing station ("ECG spot") and the name of the node's
  processing activity ("perform ECG"). For the processing node "ECG spot /
  perform ECG", the model specifies three resource objects: an "ECG
  technician" as the performer, the processing station "ECG spot" (specified
  in the node name), and an additional resource object "ECG machine".
  </p><p><a
  href="https://sim4edu.com/oesjs/core3/Diagnostic-Department-1/index.html">Run
  this model from the OESjs GitHub website</a></p><p>While this model attains
  a highly compact description of the Diagnostic Department system by
  compressing "ECG spot" resources and the "perform ECG" activity, as well as
  "US bed" resources and the "perform US scan" activity, into a corresponding
  processing node, it abstracts away from the activities of patients walking
  to the ECG room and walking from the ECG room to the US room.</p><p>The
  above model can be further refined by explicitly modeling the two patient
  activities "walk to ECG spot" and "walk to US bed". While the first of them
  requires an "ECG spot" as a resource, the second one requires a "US bed". In
  the following <abbr
  title="Discrete Event Process Modeling Notation">DPMN</abbr> process
  diagram, we do not display the rectangular container (called <em>Pool</em>)
  for the Diagnostic Department, leaving it implicit.</p><figure><img
  alt="A conceptual process model in the form of a DPMN diagram"
  src="../../../../../../DES-Engineering/chCaseStudies/img/DiagnDep_CPM2_DPMN.svg"
  width="700" /></figure><p>Notice that in this refined model, the processing
  nodes of the previous model have been resolved into corresponding processing
  activities (and associated resources).</p><p>According to DPMN's
  <em>declarative resource modeling</em> principles, a required resource will
  be allocated before an activity starts and, unless the follow-up activity
  also requires a resource of that type, released after it has completed. In
  the case of the activity sequence of "perform ECG" and "walk patient to US
  bed", however, the resource "ECG spot" must not be released before the
  follow-up activity "walk patient to US bed" starts, because it represents
  the location of the patient (in the ECG room), which only becomes available
  when the patient leaves the room (for going to the US room) and not when the
  "perform ECG" activity ends. </p><p>DPMN allows to mark such a
  <b><i>deferred resource de-allocation</i></b> with the help of a special
  resource role association end (a dot with a bar), as can be seen in the
  diagram at the "ECG spot" resource type rectangle. It means that this
  resource is not released when the activity (here "perform ECG") ends, but
  only when the follow-up activity (here "walk patient to US bed")
  starts.</p><p>In this example, the requirement for deferred resource
  de-allocation stems from the ambiguity of the ECG room (with three spots)
  representing both a spatial resource for the activity "perform ECG" and an
  input buffer for the processing activity "walk to US bed". This points to an
  intricate relationship between the concepts of spatial resources and input
  buffers in PNs, which requires further research. </p><p><a

  expression in brackets, as in <i>pizzaMakers[2]</i>, this denotes a resource
  multiplicity constraint (stating that exactly 2 pizzaMakers are required).
  When only a performer type prefixed with a colon (such as

  resource role, such as <i>oven:Oven</i>, consists of a named object
  rectangle, such as the <i>:Oven</i> rectangle in , attached to an activity
