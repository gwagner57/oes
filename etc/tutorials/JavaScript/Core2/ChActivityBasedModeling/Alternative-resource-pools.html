    <title>Alternative Resources</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>Certain activities allow alternative resources, when no standard
  resources are available. For instance, in a pizza service company, when no
  order taker is available, and a new order call comes in, an available pizza
  baker can take the order. Or in a hospital, where nurses guide patients to
  an examination room, when no nurse is available, a receptionist can guide a
  patient to an examination room.</p><p>The general conceptual pattern is that
  for certain types of activities <i>A</i> (like <i>GuideToRoom</i>), a
  resource role <i>r</i> (like <i>guide</i>) may be played not only by
  instances of its direct resource role type <i>R</i> (like <i>Guide</i>), but
  also by instances of an alternative resource role type <i>R'</i> (like
  <i>ExaminationAssistant</i>), if it is a subtype of <i>R</i> (<i>Guide</i>),
  or an organizational position <i>P</i> (like <i>Nurse</i>), if it is a
  subtype of <i>R</i> (<i>Guide</i>) or <i>R'</i>
  (<i>ExaminationAssistant</i>).</p><p>When a direct resource role type
  <i>R</i> of an activity type <i>A</i> is not abstract, then its instances
  are the preferred resources of activities of type <i>A</i>, and its
  (possibly preference-rank-annotated) subtypes specify types of alternative
  resources.</p><h4>Preferred and Alternative Resource Pools</h4><p>While
  resource roles are defined in an Object-Event-Activity (OEA) class design
  model, organizational positions and resource pools are defined, and assigned
  to resource roles, in an OEM organization design model, which is based on
  the resource role types defined in the OEA class design model. </p><p>By
  default, for any non-abstract resource role type <i>R</i> and for any
  organizational position <i>P</i> assigned as the range of a resource role
  <i>r</i>, a simulator can create a resource pool with the same (yet
  pluralized) name, holding objects instantiating <i>R</i> or <i>P</i>, and
  assign it to <i>r</i> as the preferred resource pool. </p></body>
