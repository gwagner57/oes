    <title>Waiting Timeouts</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>In certain cases, enqueued activities may have a <em>waiting
  timeout</em>, which means that such an enqueued activity will not be
  started, but removed from the queue, if its waiting time is longer than its
  timeout. This mechanism can be used for modeling the behavior of humans
  loosing patience in a queue called <em>reneging</em> in queuing theory. For
  instance, in the following DPMN diagram, the activity <i>TakeOrder</i> has a
  waiting timeout:</p><figure id="figServiceDesk0"><div><img alt="???"
  height="57" src="../img/TakeOrder-Reneging_PDM.png"
  width="189" /></div></figure><p>In OESjs, this can be coded by defining a
  class-level ("static") function <code>waitingTimeout</code> in a
  resource-constrained activity class, as shown in the following example.
  Typically, the timeout (or maximum waiting time) provided by such a function
  is sampled from a probability distribution function.</p><pre>class <b>TakeOrder</b> extends aCTIVITY {
  constructor({id, startTime, duration}={}) {
    super({id, startTime, duration});
  }
  static duration() {
    return rand.uniform( 1, 4);
  }
  static <b>waitingTimeout</b>() {
    return rand.uniformInt( 3, 6);
  }
}
TakeOrder.<b>resourceRoles</b> = {
  "orderTaker": {range: OrderTaker}
}</pre></body>
