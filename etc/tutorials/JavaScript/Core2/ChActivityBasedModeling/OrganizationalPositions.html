    <title>Organizational Positions and Resource Pools</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>Since a business process happens in the context of an organization
  (as its owner), it is natural to consider the concept of organizational
  positions. </p><p>Any <em>performer role</em> of an activity type has a
  <em>performer type</em> as its range. For instance, in the following <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class design model, the (implicitly named)
  performer role <i>orderTaker</i> of the activity type <i>TakeOrder</i> has
  the performer type <i>OrderTaker</i> as its range. Likewise the object type
  <i>PizzaMaker</i> is a performer type.</p><p>Each performer type corresponds
  to an organizational position. For instance, in the following <abbr
  title="Object Event">OE</abbr> class model, both <i>OrderTaker</i> and
  <i>PizzaMaker</i> are organizational positions, for which an organization
  hires a number of human resources, forming corresponding resource pools
  (called <i>orderTakers</i> and <i>pizzaMakers</i>). These resource pools
  correspond to the direct populations of the two organizational
  positions.</p><figure><img

  one performer role. In the model above, the organizational position
  <i>PizzaMaker</i> is an alternative resource subtype of the organizational
  position <i>OrderTaker</i>, as indicated by the generalization arrow of

  Types</h4><p>When a resource pool represents an organizational position
  charged with playing <i>n</i> performer roles, it is used by all <i>n</i>
  corresponding activity types.</p></body>
