    <title>Organizational Positions and Resource Pools</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>An <em>organizational position</em> is defined by a name and a set
  of organizational role types, which are performer types representing the
  responsibilities of the position holders. Recall that a performer is a
  special type of resource object required for performing activities of a
  certain type. For instance, in a medical department, the organizational
  position <i>Nurse</i> may be defined by the set of performer types
  <i>Guide</i> and <i>ExaminationAssistant</i>, where a <i>Guide</i> is
  required for guiding a patient to an examination room and an
  <i>ExaminationAssistant</i> is required for assisting a doctor in a medical
  examination.</p><p>Computationally, an <em>organizational position</em> is
  an object type that is a subtype of one or more performer types, implying
  that its instances (position holders) are resources that can be chosen for
  performing the corresponding activities. </p><p>For instance, the
  organizational position <i>Nurse</i> is a subtype of the performer type
  <i>Guide</i> and of the performer type <i>ExaminationAssistant</i>, with the
  meaning that nurses play both the role of guides and the role of examination
  assistants.</p><p>In simple cases, an organizational position is defined by
  just one performer type. In such a case, the organizational position is
  identified with the performer type</p><p>In an activity-based Discrete Event
  simulation, each organizational position defines a resource pool (or maybe
  better: performer pool) that includes all employees holding that
  position.</p><h4>Resource Pools Assigned to Multiple Activity
  Types</h4><p>When a resource pool represents an organizational position
  defined by <i>n</i> performer types, it is shared among all <i>n</i>
  corresponding activity types.</p></body>
