    <title>Task Priorities</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>Whenever an activity of type A1 ends and there is still another A1
  task in the queue, the activity's resources would be re-used for the next A1
  task unless there is another task (say, of type A2) with higher priority
  waiting for one of the resources (r1). In that case, r1 is allocated to that
  task, and all other resources are allocated to the next A1 task, which still
  has to wait for r1 becoming available again.</p><p>For example, in a pizza
  service, where incoming orders can be taken by pizza makers, and
  <i>TakeOrder</i> tasks have a higher priority than <i>MakePizza</i> tasks,
  when a <i>MakePizza</i> activity performed by a pizza maker in an oven ends
  while there is still another <i>MakePizza</i> task in the queue and there is
  also a <i>TakeOrder</i> task in the queue, the pizza maker is allocated to
  the <i>TakeOrder</i> task and the oven is allocated to the next
  <i>MakePizza</i> task, which has to wait for a pizza maker becoming
  available.</p><p><b>Algorithmically</b>: Whenever an activity a1 of type A1
  ends, collect all pairs &lt;r, t&gt; such that r is a resource used by a1
  and t is the next task of an activity type A from the dependent activity
  types DAT of pool(r) with the highest priority among all DAT with task
  priorities higher than A1. For all these pairs &lt;r, t&gt;, allocate r to
  t. Allocate the remaining resources of a1 to the next A1 task, if there is
  any, otherwise release them. </p><p></p></body>
