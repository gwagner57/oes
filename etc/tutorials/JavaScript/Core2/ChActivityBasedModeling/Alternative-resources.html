    <title>Alternative Resources</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>Certain activities allow alternative resources, when no standard
  resources are available. For instance, in a pizza service company, when no
  order taker is available, and a new order call comes in, an available pizza
  baker can take the order. Or in a hospital, where nurses guide patients to
  an examination room, when no nurse is available, a receptionist can guide a
  patient to an examination room.</p><p>The general conceptual pattern is that
  for certain types of activities <i>A</i> (like <i>GuideToRoom</i>), a
  resource role <i>r</i> (like <i>guide</i>) may be played not only by
  instances of its direct resource type <i>R</i> (like <i>Guide</i>), but also
  by instances of an alternative resource type <i>R'</i> (like
  <i>ExaminationAssistant</i>) or an organizational position <i>P</i> (like
  <i>Nurse</i>), if they are a subtypes of <i>R</i> (<i>Guide</i>).</p><p>When
  the resource type <i>R</i> is not abstract, then its instances are the
  preferred resources of activities of type <i>A</i>, and its (possibly
  preference-rank-annotated) «ar» subtypes specify types of alternative
  resources.</p><h4>Preferred and Alternative Resource Pools</h4><p>Resource
  roles, resource types, organizational positions and resource pools are
  defined in an <abbr style="Object-Event">OE</abbr> class design model. Each
  resource role has a resource type or an organizational position as its range
  and an assigned resource pool . </p><p>By default, for any non-abstract
  resource type <i>R</i> and for any organizational position <i>P</i> assigned
  as the range of a resource role <i>r</i>, an <abbr
  style="Object-Event">OE</abbr> simulator can create a resource pool with the
  same (yet pluralized) name, pooling objects instantiating <i>R</i> or
  <i>P</i>, and assign it to <i>r</i> as the preferred resource pool.
