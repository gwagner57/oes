# OES Rust Core 1 Simulator 

The OESrs Core 1 simulator implements an architecture for Object Event Simulation (OES), extending the OESjs Core 0 simulator 
by adding fixed-increment time progression, a seedable random number generator, a set of sampling functions from various 
probability distributions (uniform, triangular, normal, exponential, etc.), multiple scenarios per model, 
multiple experiment types per model, model parameters, parameter variation experiments, as well as persistent storage 
and export of experiment results.
