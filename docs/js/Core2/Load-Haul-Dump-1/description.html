  Model</summary><p>A haul service company has resource pools for dump trucks
  and wheel loaders. While the activities <em>go (back) to loading site</em>,
  <em>haul</em>, <em>dump</em> and <em>go home</em> just require a
  <em>truck</em> (or a <em>wheel loader</em>) as a resource, <em>load</em>
  activities require both a <em>truck</em> and a <em>wheel
  loader</em>.</p><details><summary>Conceptual Information
  Model</summary><p>The potentially relevant object types are:</p><ol>
      <li>haul service company,</li>

      <li>wheel loaders,</li>

      <li>dump trucks.</li>
    </ol><p>Potentially relevant types of events and activities are:</p><ol>
      <li>haul requests coming in from customers,</li>

      <li>going to the loading site (an activity performed by trucks and by
      wheel loaders),</li>

      <li>loading (performed by wheel loaders using trucks as resources),</li>

      <li>hauling (performed by trucks),</li>

      <li>dumping (performed by trucks),</li>

      <li>going back to loading site (performed by trucks),</li>

      <li>going home when the job is done (performed by trucks and by wheel
      loaders).</li>
    </ol><p>Both object types and event types, together with their
  participation associations, can be visually described in a conceptual
  information model in the form of a UML class diagram, as shown
  below.</p><figure><figcaption>A conceptual information model describing
  object, event and activity types.</figcaption><img alt="???"
  src="img/CIM.svg" width="500" /></figure><p>Notice that the association end
  annotations «rr» and «rp» denote <em>resource roles</em> and <em>resource
  pools</em>. A haul service company has resource pools for trucks and wheel
  loaders. The activity types <em>haul</em>, <em>dump</em> and <em>go back to
  loading site</em> have a resource role <em>truck</em> for assigning a truck
  to any activity of one of those types. The activity types <em>go to loading
  site</em> and <em>go home</em> have either a a resource role <em>truck</em>
  or a resource role <em>wheel loader</em>, as indicated by the
  <em>alternative association</em> constraint expressed with a dashed line
  annotated with <em>{xor}</em>. The activity type <em>load</em> has both
  resource role <em>truck</em> and a resource role <em>wheel loaders</em> for
  assigning at least one and at most two wheel loaders to any <em>load</em>
  activity (as indicated by the multiplicity "1..2" at the «rr» association
  end at the class <em>wheel
  loaders</em>).</p></details><details><summary>Conceptual Process
  Model</summary><p>The involved types of events and activities can be related
  with each other via <em>resource-dependent activity start arrows</em> and
  <em>event scheduling arrows</em>, as shown in the following DPMN process
  diagram:</p><figure><img
  alt="A DPMN diagram showing a conceptual process model" src="img/CPMa.svg"
  width="600" /></figure><p>Notice that there are three types of arrows in
  this DPMN diagram:</p><ol>
      <li><strong><em>Event Scheduling</em></strong> arrows, like the one
      between <em>load</em> and <em>haul</em>, have the meaning that the
      succeeding activity is started as soon as the preceding activity has
      been completed (there is no need for enqueuing a planned activity, since
      all resources required by the succeeding activity are provided by the
      preceding activity). Event Scheduling arrows are not part of BPMN,
      rather they have been proposed by Schruben (1983) for <a
      href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358460" rel="nofollow noopener"
      target="_blank">Event Graphs</a>.</li>

      <li>A <strong><em>Multiple Events Scheduling</em></strong> arrow, like
      the one between <em>requests</em> and <em>go to loading site</em>, means
      that one instance of the preceding event type triggers multiple
      instances of the succeeding event type. In our example model, this means
      that one <em>request</em> event is followed by multiple <em>go to
      loading site</em> activities, one for each truck and each wheel loader
      assigned to the job.</li>

      <li>A <strong><em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em></strong> arrow,
      like the one between <em>go to loading site</em> and <em>load</em>
      activities, means that as soon as an activity of the preceding activity
      type has been completed, a new planned activity is added to the queue of
      planned activities of the succeeding type (and started as soon as all
      required resources are available).</li>
    </ol><p>The model shows that when a haul request comes in, the haul
  service company deploys multiple trucks and wheel loaders to the loading
  site, each of them performing a <em>go to loading site</em> activity, as
  indicated by the double arrow between the <i>haul requests</i> event circle
  and the <em>go to loading site</em> activity rectangle. Each of these
  activities leads to enqueuing a new planned <em>load</em> activity, as
  indicated by the <em>resource-dependent activity start arrow</em> from the
  <em>go to loading site</em> activity shape to the <em>load</em> activity
  shape. Such an enqueued (planned) activity is going to be dequeued and
  started as soon as the required resources become available. This means that
  as soon as a wheel loader is available, the next <em>load</em> activity is
  going to be started. When a <em>load</em> activity is completed, a
  <em>haul</em> activity and then a <em>dump</em> activity are going to start
  immediately, as indicated by the <em>event scheduling arrows</em> between
  them.</p><p>A more complete model prevents trucks to go back to the loading
  site and perform a load activity even when the job has been completed during
  the go back activity (resulting in haul and dump activities with an empty
  truck). For avoiding this uneconomic behavior, a second decision if the job
  has been done needs to be taken after the go back activity. In addition, the
  model has to describe that wheel loaders also go home when their job has
  been done. This is shown in the following refined model:</p><figure><img
  alt="???" src="img/CPMb.svg"
  width="650" /></figure></details></details><details><summary>Simulation
  Design</summary><p>In our simulation design, we consider only one particular
  haul service company, which does not have to be modeled as an explicit
  object. Also, we abstract away from the fact that also wheel loaders have to
  go to, and return from, the loading site by assuming that they are already
  at the site when the dump trucks arrive.</p><details><summary>Information
  Design Model</summary><p>In the information design model, we need to define
  a <i>status</i> attribute for all resource object types, such as
  <i>Truck</i> and <i>WheelLoader</i>, and a duration function, typically
  representing a random variable, for each activity
  type:</p><figure><figcaption>An information design model defining object,
  event and activity types.</figcaption><img alt="???" src="img/IDM.svg"
  width="600" /></figure><p>Notice how functions representing random
  variables, like the <code>duration</code> function of all activity types,
  are marked with the keyword (or UML 'stereotype') «rv» standing for "random
  variable". These random variable functions sample from a probability
  distribution function (PDF), which is symbolically indicated with
  expressions like Tri(30,50,40) standing for the triangular PDF with lower
  and upper bounds 30 and 50, and a median of 40. </p><p>Each activity type is
  associated with <i>Truck</i> or <i>WheelLoader</i> as their resource
  role(s), indicated with the association end stereotype «rr» standing for
  "resource role".</p></details><details><summary>Process Design
  Model</summary><p>In the process design model, we need to specify the state
  changes and follow-up events caused by events, including activity start and
  end events, and the constructor arguments for scheduling follow-up events,
  using model variables (possibly referencing resource pools), as shown in the
  following DPMN diagram:</p><figure><figcaption>A computationally complete
  process design for the Load-Haul-Dump business process.</figcaption><img
  alt="???" src="img/PDM.svg"
  width="700" /></figure></details></details><details><summary>Implementation
  with OESjs</summary><p>The JavaScript-based simulator OESjs implements the
  Object Event Simulation paradigm, and, consequently, allows a
  straight-forward coding of OEM class models and DPMN process
  models.</p><details><summary>Implementing the Information Design
  Model</summary><p>For implementing the information design model, we have to
  code all object types, event types and activity types specified in the model
  in the form of classes.</p><figure class="right"><img alt="???"
  src="img/Truck_IDM.svg" width="300" /></figure><p>The <code>Truck</code>
  object class can be coded with OESjs-Core2 in the following way:</p><pre>class <b>Truck</b> extends oBJECT {
  constructor({ id, name, <b>status</b>}) {
    super( id, name);  // invoke the oBJECT constructor
    <b>this.status</b> = status;
  }
}
// a class-level attribute
Truck.<b>capacity</b> = 15;  // m3</pre><p>All object classes inherit an
  <code>id</code> attribute and a <code>name</code> attribute from the
  pre-defined OES foundation class <code>oBJECT</code>. Since trucks are
  resource objects, we need to define a <code>status</code> property for them.
  We also define a class-level attribute <code>capacity</code> for modeling
  their load capacity, assuming that all trucks have the same
  capacity.</p><p>The <i>WheelLoader</i> object class is coded in the same way
  as <i>Truck</i>.</p><figure class="right"><img alt="HaulRequest event class"
  src="img/HaulRequest_IDM.svg" width="180" /></figure><p>The
  <code>HaulRequest</code> event class can be coded in the following
  way:</p><pre>class <b>HaulRequest</b> extends eVENT {
  constructor({ occTime, delay, <b>quantity</b>}) {
    super({occTime, delay});
    <b>this.quantity</b> = quantity;
  }
  onEvent() {
    ...
  }
}</pre><p>All event classes inherit an <code>occTime</code> attribute and a
  <code>delay</code> attribute from the pre-defined OES foundation class
  <code>eVENT</code>. Any event in OES can be created either with a value for
  the attribute <code>occTime</code> (standing for <em>occurrence time</em>)
  or with a value for the attribute <code>delay</code>. In the latter case,
  the event's occurrence time is automatically derived by adding the value of
  <code>delay</code> to the current simulation time. In addition, the
  <i>HaulRequest</i> event class has a property <code>quantity</code> for
  specifying the quantity to be hauled.. </p><p>The <code>onEvent</code>
  method of the <i>HaulRequest</i> event class is not part of the information
  design model. Rather, it is implementing an event rule specified in the
  process design model. Consequently, it will be discussed below.</p><figure
  class="right"><img alt="GoToLoadingSite activity class"
  src="img/GoToLoadingSite_IDM.svg" width="400" /></figure><p>The
  <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> activity class can be coded in the following
  way:</p><pre>class <b>GoToLoadingSite</b> extends aCTIVITY {
  constructor({id, startTime, duration}={}) {
    super({id, startTime, duration});
  }
  static <b>duration</b>() {return rand.triangular( 30, 50, 40);}
}
GoToLoadingSite.<b>resourceRoles</b> = {
  "truck": {range: Truck}
}</pre><p>All activity classes inherit the attributes <code>id</code>,
  <code>startTime</code> and <code>duration</code> from the pre-defined OES
  foundation class <code>aCTIVITY</code>. When an activity is created as a JS
  object during a simulation run, the value of its <code>duration</code>
  property is obtained by invoking the <code>duration()</code> function
  defined as a class-level ("static") function for its activity class. These
  activity duration functions typically implement a random variable by
  invoking a random variate sampling function, such as
  <code>rand.triangular(30,50,40)</code>, which samples from the triangular
  probability distribution function (with min/max=30/50 and
  mode=40).</p><p>Notice how the resource role association between
  <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> and <i>Truck</i>, which defines the resource
  reference property <i>GoToLoadingSite::truck</i>, is coded by a
  corresponding entry in the map-valued class-level property
  <code>resourceRoles</code>.</p></details><details
  open="open"><summary>Implementing the Process Design Model</summary><p>A
  DPMN process design model can be decomposed into a set of event rule design
  models, one for each type of event specified in the design model. Starting
  with the <code>HaulRequest</code> event rule design model, we show how the
  event rules specified by each of these event rule design models can be coded
  in the form of an <code>onEvent</code> method.</p><figure><figcaption>A
  design model for the <code>HaulRequest</code> event rule.</figcaption><img
  src="img/HaulRequest_RDM.svg" width="300" /></figure><p>In the following
  <code>HaulRequest</code> event rule method <code>onEvent</code>, all
  available trucks are allocated to the current haul request, and, after
  computing the number of loads, for each of the allocated trucks a new
  <code>GoToLoadingSite</code> activity is started:</p><pre>class <b>HaulRequest</b> extends eVENT {
  ...
  <b>onEvent</b>() {
    const followupEvents=[],
          allocatedTrucks = sim.resourcePools["trucks"].<b>allocateAll</b>();
    // assign model variable
    sim.model.v.<b>nmrOfLoads</b> = Math.ceil( this.quantity / Truck.capacity);
    for (const t of allocatedTrucks) {
      const goActy = <b>new GoToLoadingSite</b>();
      // assign truck as required resource
      goActy.truck = t;
      // start GoToLoadingSite activity
      followupEvents.push( <b>new aCTIVITYsTART</b>({plannedActivity: goActy}));
    }
    return followupEvents;
  }
}</pre><p>Since activities are composite events, we also have event rules for
  them. The following <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> event rule is triggered whenever
  a <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> activity is completed, since the completion of an
  activity counts as its occurrence event.</p><figure><figcaption>A design
  model for the <code>GoToLoadingSite</code> event rule.</figcaption><img
  alt="???" src="img/GoToLoadingSite_RDM.svg" width="250" /></figure><p>This
  rule states that whenever a <i>GoToLoadingSite</i> activity ends (or is
  completed), then a new planned <i>Load</i> activity is enqueued, if no wheel
  loader is available, or, otherwise, a new <i>Load</i> activity is started.
  In OESjs, it is coded in the following declarative way: </p><pre>GoToLoadingSite.<b>successorActivity</b> = "Load"</pre><p>Such
  a successor activity assignment allows the simulator to check if the
  required resources are available and then start the successor activity, or,
  otherwise, enqueue a new planned successor
  activity.</p><figure><figcaption>A design model for the <code>Load</code>
  event rule.</figcaption><img alt="???" src="img/Load_RDM.svg"
  width="220" /></figure><p>This rule states that whenever a <i>Load</i>
  activity ends, the model variable <i>nmrOfLoads</i> is decremented by 1, and
  a <i>Haul</i> activity is immediately started (as a successor activity).
  Since the <i>Haul</i> activity doesn't require any additional resources,
  there is no need to enqueue a planned activity and wait for the availability
  of resources. In OESjs, this rule is coded in the following way:</p><pre>class <b>Load</b> extends aCTIVITY {
  ...
  <b>onActivityEnd</b>() {
    const followupEvents = [];
    // decrement nmrOfLoads counter
    sim.model.v.nmrOfLoads--;
    return followupEvents;
  }
  ...
}
Load.<b>successorActivity</b> = "Haul";</pre><p>Notice that the state change
  expressed in the <i>modelVariables</i> object rectangle, the decrementation
  of <i>nmrOfLoads</i>, is taken care of in the <code>onActivityEnd</code>
  method of the <code>Load</code> activity class. Instead of explicitly
  scheduling the start of the succeeding <code>Haul</code> activity in that
  method, we simply define <code>Haul</code> to be the successor activity of
  <code>Load</code>.</p><figure><figcaption>A design model for the
  <code>Haul</code> event rule.</figcaption><img alt="???"
  src="img/Haul_RDM.svg" width="220" /></figure><p>The <i>Haul</i> event rule
  states that whenever a <i>Haul</i> activity ends, it is immediately
  succeeded by a <i>Dump</i> activity. It is coded in the following
  way:</p><pre>Haul.<b>successorActivity</b> = "Dump";</pre><figure><figcaption>A
  design model for the <code>Dump</code> event rule.</figcaption><img
  alt="???" src="img/Dump_RDM.svg" width="330" /></figure><p>The <i>Dump</i>
  event rule states that when a <i>Dump</i> activity ends and the model
  variable <i>nmrOfLoads</i> has the value 0, it is immediately succeeded by a
  <i>GoHome</i> activity, otherwise it is immediately succeeded by a
  <i>GoBackToLoadingSite</i> activity. The rule is coded by defining the
  successor activity as a function returning either "GoBackToLoadingSite" or
  "GoHome" in the following way:</p><pre>Dump.<b>successorActivity</b> = function () {
  return sim.model.v.nmrOfLoads === 0 ? "GoHome":"GoBackToLoadingSite";
}</pre><figure><figcaption>A design model for the
  <code>GoBackToLoadingSite</code> event rule.</figcaption><img alt="???"
  src="img/GoBackToLoadingSite_RDM.svg" width="350" /></figure><p>The
  <i>GoBackToLoadingSite</i> event rule states that when a
  <i>GoBackToLoadingSite</i> activity ends and the model variable
  <i>nmrOfLoads</i> still has a value greater than 0, a new planned
  <i>Load</i> activity is enqueued; otherwise a <i>GoHome</i> activity is
  immediately started. The rule is coded by defining the successor activity of
  <i>GoBackToLoadingSite</i> as a function returning either "Load" or "GoHome"
  in the following way:</p><pre>GoBackToLoadingSite.<b>successorActivity</b> = function () {
  return sim.model.v.nmrOfLoads &gt; 0 ? "Load":"GoHome";
