  and wheel loaders. While <em>go (back) to loading site</em>, <em>haul</em>,

  (or a <em>wheel loader</em>) as a resource, <em>load</em> activities require
  both a <em>truck</em> and a <em>wheel loader</em>.</p><details

      <li>going home when the job is done (performed by trucks and by wheel
      loaders).</li>
    </ol> <p>Both object types and event types, together with their
  participation associations, can be visually described in a conceptual
  information model in the form of a UML class diagram, as shown below.</p>

  information model describing object, event and activity
  types.</figcaption></figure><p>Notice that the association end stereotypes
  «rr» and «rp» denote <em>resource roles</em> and <em>resource pools</em>. A
  haul service company has resource pools for trucks and wheel loaders. The
  activity types <em>haul</em>, <em>dump</em> and <em>go back to loading
  site</em> have a resource role <em>truck</em> for assigning a truck to any
  activity of one of those types. The activity types <em>go to loading
  site</em> and <em>go home</em> have either a a resource role <em>truck</em>
  or a resource role <em>wheel loader</em>. The activity type <em>load</em>
  has both resource role <em>truck</em> and a resource role <em>wheel
  loaders</em> for assigning at least one and at most two wheel loaders to any
  <em>load</em> activity (as indicated by the multiplicity "1..2" at the «rr»
  association end at the class <em>wheel loaders</em>).</p></details><details
  open="open"><summary>Conceptual Process Model</summary><p>The involved types
  of events and activities can be related with each other via
  <em>resource-dependent activity start arrows</em> and <em>event scheduling
  arrows</em>, as shown in the following DPMN process diagram:</p> <figure>
  <img src="img/CPMa.svg" width="600" /> <figcaption>A DPMN diagram showing a
  conceptual process model.</figcaption> </figure><p>The model shows that when
  a load-haul-dump request comes in, as indicated by the double arrow, the
  haul service company deploys multiple trucks and wheel loaders to the
  loading site (each of them performs a <em>go to loading site</em> activity).
  Each of these activities leads to enqueuing a new <em>load</em> activity, as
  indicated by the <em>resource-dependent activity start arrow</em> from the
  <em>go to loading site</em> activity shape to the <em>load</em> activity
  shape. Such an enqueued (planned) activity is going to be dequeued and
  started as soon as the required resources are available. This means that as
  soon as a wheel loader is available the next <em>load</em> activity is going
  to be started. When a <em>load</em> activity is completed, a <em>haul</em>
  activity and then a <em>dump</em> activity are going to start immediately,
  as indicated by the <em>event scheduling arrows</em> between them.</p> <p>A
  more complete model prevents trucks to go back to the loading site and
  perform a load activity even when the job has been completed during the go
  back activity (resulting in haul and dump activities with an empty truck).
  For avoiding this uneconomic behavior, a second decision if the job has been
  done needs to be taken after the go back activity. In addition, the model
  has to describe that wheel loaders also go home when their job has been
  done. This is shown in the following refined model:</p> <figure> <img

  model.</figcaption> </figure>
  </details></details><details><summary>Simulation Design</summary> <p>In our
  simulation design, we consider only one particular haul service company,
  which does not have to be modeled explicitly. Also, we abstract away from
  the fact that also wheel loaders have to go to, and return from, the loading
  site by assuming that they are already at the site when the dump trucks
  arrive.</p> <details><summary>Information Design Model</summary> <p>In the
  information design model, we need to define a <i>status</i> attribute for
  all resource object types, such as <i>Truck</i> and <i>WheelLoader</i>, and
  a duration function, typically representing a random variable, for each
  activity type:</p> <figure> <img src="img/IDM.svg" width="600" />
  <figcaption>An information design model defining object, event and activity
  types.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Notice how functions representing random
  variables, like <code>duration()</code>, are marked with the keyword (or UML
  stereotype) «rv» standing for "random variable".</p> </details>
  <details><summary>Process Design Model</summary> <p>In the process design
  model, we need to specify the state changes caused by events (including
  activity start and end events) and the constructor arguments for scheduling
  follow-up events, using model variables (possibly referencing resource
  pools), as shown in the following DPMN diagram:</p> <figure> <img
  src="img/PDM.svg" width="700" /> <figcaption>A computationally complete
  process design for the Load-Haul-Dump-1 model.</figcaption> </figure>

  <p>The JavaScript-based simulator OESjs implements the Object Event
  Simulation paradigm, and, consequently, allows a straight-forward coding of
  OEM class models and DPMN process models.</p> <details><summary>Implementing
