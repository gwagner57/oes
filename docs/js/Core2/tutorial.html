Activities are composed of a start event and an end event. Resource-constrained activities are modeled by means of <em>Resource Roles</em> (with <em>Resource Constraints</em>) and <em>Resource Pools</em>. They can only be started when their required resources are available. Due to this dependency, a simulated activity cannot be scheduled like a simulated event. Rather, it has to be added to a queue of planned activities, from which it is dequeued, and scheduled via an immediate activity start event, as soon as the required resources become available. </p></div></div><div class="role-frontmatter" id="frontmatter"><section class="role-toc" id="toc"><h1 class="role-toc-title">Table of Contents</h1><ul class="role-booklist-entries"><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-lof"><a class="role-lof-ref" href="#lof">List of Figures</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-lot"><a class="role-lot-ref" href="#lot">List of Tables</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-chapter"><a class="role-chapter-ref" href="#index"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1</span>. </span>Introduction to Object Event Modeling of Activities</a><ul class="role-booklist-entries"><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#CM"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.1</span>. </span>Making a Conceptual Model of the System under Investigation</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#DesM"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.2</span>. </span>Making Simulation Design Models</a></li></ul></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-chapter"><a class="role-chapter-ref" href="#index-2"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2</span>. </span>Creating Activity-Based Discrete Event Simulations with OESjs-Core2</a><ul class="role-booklist-entries"><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimTime"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.1</span>. </span>Simulation Time</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimModels"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.2</span>. </span>Simulation Models</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimScenarios"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.3</span>. </span>Simulation Scenarios</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimStatistics"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.4</span>. </span>Statistics</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimExperiments"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.5</span>. </span>Simulation Experiments</a></li></ul></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-appendix"><a class="role-appendix-ref" href="#architecture"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">A</span>. </span>Simulator Architecture</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-index"><a class="role-index-ref" href="#_index">Index</a></li></ul></section><section class="role-lof" id="lof"><h1 class="role-lof-title">List of Figures</h1></section><section class="role-lot" id="lot"><h1 class="role-lot-title">List of Tables</h1><ul class="role-booklist-entries"><li class="role-booklist-entry"><a class="role-table-ref" href="#SimScenarios__lot__1"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2-1</span>. </span>Simulation Log</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry"><a class="role-table-ref" href="#SimScenarios__lot__2"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2-2</span>. </span>Simulation Log</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry"><a class="role-table-ref" href="#SimStatistics__lot__3"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2-3</span>. </span>Statistics</a></li></ul></section></div><section class="role-chapter" id="index"><h1 class="role-chapter-title"><span class="role-label">Chapter <span class="role-number">1</span>. </span>Introduction to Object Event Modeling of Activities</h1><p>This chapter shows how to make <em>activity-based Discrete Event Simulation models</em> using the paradigm of <em>Object Event Modeling and Simulation</em> (OEM&amp;S) with UML Class Diagrams and DPMN Process Diagrams.

So, in our extended model of a medical department we consider two other resource types, <em>examination rooms</em> and <em>nurses</em>, and another type of activity: <em>walks to rooms</em> (the walks of patients to examination rooms guided by nurses):</p><ul><li>Patients arrive at a medical department at random times.</li><li>When a new patient arrives, and an examination room and a nurse are available, that nurse walks the patient to that room, otherwise the patient has to wait for the availability of an examination room and a nurse (administratively, a new planned walk is added to the queue/list of planned walks).</li><li>When a nurse has walked a patient to a room and a doctor is available, an examination of the patient by that doctor in the room starts; otherwise the patient has to wait for the availability of a doctor (administratively, a new planned examination is placed in the queue/list of planned examinations).</li><li><p>When an examination of a patient by a doctor in a room is completed,</p><ol><li>if there is still another planned examination of a patient waiting in a room for the availability of a doctor, the doctor goes to that room and starts the examination of that patient; otherwise, the planned examination of the newly arrived patient is added to a list of planned examinations (representing a queue);</li><li>if there is still another planned walk of a patient to a room waiting for the availability of a room, the room is allocated to this planned walk; if a nurse is available, she walks the patient to that room.</li></ol></li><li>The duration of walks and examinations varies, depending on the individual case.</li></ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>object types</b> of the system under investigation are: <em>patients</em>, <em>medical departments</em>, <em>rooms</em>, <em>nurses</em> and <em>doctors</em>.</p><p>The potentially relevant <b>event types</b> are <em>patient arrivals</em> and the activity types <em>walks to rooms</em> and <em>examinations</em>.</p><p>Thus, we get the following conceptual information model expressed as an OEM Class Diagram:</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CIM2.svg" width="600" /></div></figure><p>Notice that in this model, (a) the performer resource role is explicitly marked with «performer»: a <em>nurse</em> is a performer of <em>walks to rooms</em> while a <em>doctor</em> is a performer of <em>examinations</em>, and (b) the stereotypes «resource role» and «resource pool» have been abbreviated by «rr» and «rp». </p><p>From the diagram we can infer that:</p><ul><li>For the event type <em>patient arrivals</em> and for the activity types <em>walks to rooms</em> and <em>examinations</em>, there is an association with <em>medical departments</em> providing the <em>process owner</em>.</li><li>While <em>patient arrivals</em> have two participants: a <em>patient</em> and a <em>medical department</em>, <em>walks</em> and <em>examinations</em> have four participants: a <em>medical department</em>, a <em>patient</em>, a <em>nurse</em> or a <em>doctor</em>, and a <em>room</em>.</li><li><em>Walks</em> have two resource roles, <em>nurse</em> and <em>room</em>, both with a resource constraint of exactly one, which means that exactly one <em>nurse</em> and one <em>room</em> are required for performing a <em>walk</em>.</li><li><em>Examinations</em> have two resource roles, <em>doctor</em> and <em>room</em>, both with a resource constraint of exactly one.</li><li>The process owner of a <em>walk to a room</em> and a subsequent <em>examination</em>, a <em>medical department</em>, has three resource pools for <em>nurses</em>, <em>rooms</em> and <em>doctors</em>. All required resources needed for performing <em>walks to room</em> and <em>examinations</em> at this department are allocated from these pools, and the department has corresponding business procedures for allocating rooms, nurses and doctors using certain allocation policies.</li></ul><p>In addition to a conceptual information model, which captures the system's state structure, we also need to make a conceptual process model that captures the dynamics of the system. A process model can be expressed with the help of event rules, which define what happens when an event (of a certain type) occurs, or, more specifically, which state changes and which follow-up events are caused by an event of that type.</p><p>The following conceptual process model (in the form of a DPMN Process Diagram) is based on the information model above. It refers to the object types <i>medical departments</i> and <i>doctors</i>, as well as to the event type <i>patient arrivals</i> and to the activity type <i>examinations</i>.</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CPM2.svg" width="700" /></div></figure><p>This process model describes three causal regularities in the form of the following three event rules:</p><ol><li><p>When a new patient arrives:</p><ul><li>if a room and a nurse are available, they are allocated to the walk of that patient to that room, otherwise a new planned walk is placed in the corresponding queue;</li><li>if a room has been allocated, then the nurse starts walking the patient to the room.</li></ul></li><li><p>When a walk of a patient and nurse to a room is completed:</p><ul><li>if there is still a planned walk in the queue and a room is available, then the room is allocab</li><li>ted and the nurse is re-allocated to the walk of the next patient to that room.<br />if a doctor is available, she is allocated to the examination of that patient, else a new planned examination of that patient is queued up;</li><li>if a doctor has been allocated, then the examination of that patient starts<br />if the nurse has been re-allocated, she starts walking the next patient to the allocated room.</li></ul></li><li><p>When an examination of a patient is completed by a doctor in a particular room:</p><ul><li>if there is still a planned examination (of another patient in another room), then re-allocate the doctor to that planned examination, else release the doctor;<br />if the waiting line is not empty, re-allocate the room to the next patient, else release the room;</li><li>if the doctor has been re-allocated to a planned examination, that examination starts;<br />if the room has been re-allocated to another patient, that patient starts walking to the room.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Since, again, the resource management logic in this example complies with the standard resource management procedures built into OES Core 2, we can simplify the model by using <em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em> arrows resulting in an <i>Activity Network</i> model, as shown in the following DPMN process diagram:</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CPM2a.svg" width="400" /></div></figure><p>We can exhibit the two performer roles <em>doctor</em> and <em>nurse</em> with the help of two corresponding <strong>Lanes</strong> shown within the process owner <em>Pool</em>:</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CPM2b.svg" width="300" /></div></figure></section></section><section class="role-section1" id="DesM"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.2</span>. </span>Making Simulation Design Models</h2><p>When making a simulation design based on a conceptual model of the system under investigation, we may abstract away from certain items of the conceptual model for obtaining a sufficiently simple design. The right degree of abstraction depends on the purpose of the model.</p><p>In our example of a medical department, the purpose of the simulation model is to compute the <em>maximum queue length</em> and the <em>resource utilization</em> for all types of activities. So, we may abstract away from the object type <em>patients</em> since we don't need any information about individual patients. If we don't need utilization statistics per doctor, but only the average utilization of all doctors, then we may also abstract away from the object type <i>doctors</i> This is the approach chosen in our design models <i>Medical-Department-0</i> and <i>Medical-Department-1</i>, while we keep the object type <i>doctors</i> for modeling individual doctors in the design model <i>Medical-Department-2</i>.</p><p>Since we abstract away from individual patients, we rename <i>patient arrival</i> events to <i>NewCase</i> events, each of them representing a new case for an examination to be planned and performed.</p><p>The event type <i>NewCase</i> is a type of exogenous events,<a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__1"></a> which are not caused by any causal regularity of the system under investigation and, therefore, have to be modeled with a recurrence<a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__2"></a> function that allows to compute the time of the next occurrence of an event of that type.</p><section><h4>1.2.1. Design models based on the basic conceptual model</h4><p>We model the random variations of two variables, the recurrence of new cases and the duration of examinations, in the form of random variables<a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__3"></a> as special class-level (&quot;static&quot;) functions, with a stereotype «rv», in the class to which they belong, as shown in the diagrams below.</p><p>The recurrence of <i>NewCase</i> events is modeled as a random variable with an exponential distribution having an event rate of 0.7 per minute. The duration of examinations is modeled as a random variable with a uniform distribution having lower bound 5 and upper bound 9.</p><section><h5>The Medical-Department-1a design model</h5><p>In the <a href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core2/Medical-Department-1a/index.html">Medical-Department-1a</a> information design model, instead of using the built-in generic resource management logic, we explicitly model the resource management of doctors with the help of a counter variable for available doctors in the form of an attribute <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i>, and the operations <i>isDoctorAvailable()</i>, <i>allocateDoctor()</i> and <i>releaseDoctor()</i>, in the <i>MedicalDepartment</i> class:</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CIM1-IDM1a.svg" width="500" /></div></figure><p>The <i>isDoctorAvailable</i> function simply tests if <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i> &gt; 0, while the procedures <i>allocateDoctor</i> and <i>releaseDoctor</i> decrement and increment the <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i> counter.</p><p>In addition to an information design model for defining the simulation's state structure, we also need to make a process design model for defining the dynamics of the simulation. The following DPMN process diagram defines two event rules:</p><figure><div><img src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CPM1-PDM1a.svg" /></div></figure><p>Notice that this process design model contains the entire resource management logic for (de-)allocating doctors to (from) examinations. Since standard resource management procedures can be defined in a generic way, this logic (and the related code) can be moved from example models to the simulator, as explained in the next section.</p><p>The following table shows the two event rules defined by the above DPMN diagram, expressed in pseudo-code.</p><table border="1" style="border-spacing:3px;width:100%;"><thead><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>ON (event type)</b></p></td><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>DO (event routine)</b></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>NewCase( <i>md</i>) @ t<br />with <i>md</i> : MedicalDepartment</p></td><td><pre>newExam = new Examination( md);

Since the event rules of the Medical-Department-1a model have only be concerned with resource management, we can discard them altogether.</li></ol><p>In the resulting DPMN diagram, the event type <i>NewCase</i> is connected to the activity type <i>Examination</i> with a <em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em> arrow:</p><figure><div><img src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CPM1-PDM1b.svg" width="300" /></div></figure><p>Using a <em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em> arrow from <i>NewCase</i> to <i>Examination</i> implies that upon a <i>NewCase</i> event a new planned <i>Examination</i> activity is enqueued by the simulator, if the required resources are not available; otherwise, a new <i>Examination</i> activity is scheduled to start immediately. Using this built-in standard resource management logic relieves the simulation developer from coding the resource availability tests and the enqueuing of a new <i>Examination</i> activity in a <i>NewCase</i> event rule.</p><p>Since in this model, <i>NewCase</i> events and <i>Examination</i> activities are handled according to the generic logic of <i>Activity Networks</i> built into the <em>OES Core 2</em> simulator, we do not need to model/specify any event rules.
