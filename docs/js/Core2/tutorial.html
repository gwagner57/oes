Activities are composed of a start event and an end event. Resource-constrained activities are modeled by means of <em>Resource Roles</em> (with <em>Resource Constraints</em>) and <em>Resource Pools</em>. They can only be started when their required resources are available. Due to this dependency, a simulated activity cannot be scheduled like a simulated event. Rather, it has to be added to a queue of planned activities, from which it is dequeued, and scheduled via an immediate activity start event, as soon as the required resources become available. </p></div></div><div class="role-frontmatter" id="frontmatter"><section class="role-toc" id="toc"><h1 class="role-toc-title">Table of Contents</h1><ul class="role-booklist-entries"><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-lof"><a class="role-lof-ref" href="#lof">List of Figures</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-lot"><a class="role-lot-ref" href="#lot">List of Tables</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-chapter"><a class="role-chapter-ref" href="#index"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1</span>. </span>Introduction to Object Event Modeling of Activities</a><ul class="role-booklist-entries"><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#CM"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.1</span>. </span>Making a Conceptual Model of the System under Investigation</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#DesM"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.2</span>. </span>Making Simulation Design Models</a></li></ul></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-chapter"><a class="role-chapter-ref" href="#index-2"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2</span>. </span>Creating Activity-Based Discrete Event Simulations with OESjs-Core2</a><ul class="role-booklist-entries"><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimTime"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.1</span>. </span>Simulation Time</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimModels"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.2</span>. </span>Simulation Models</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimScenarios"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.3</span>. </span>Simulation Scenarios</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimStatistics"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.4</span>. </span>Statistics</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimExperiments"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.5</span>. </span>Simulation Experiments</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-section1"><a class="role-section1-ref" href="#SimLog"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.6</span>. </span>Using the Simulation Log</a></li></ul></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-appendix"><a class="role-appendix-ref" href="#architecture"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">A</span>. </span>Simulator Architecture</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry booklist-entry-for-index"><a class="role-index-ref" href="#_index">Index</a></li></ul></section><section class="role-lof" id="lof"><h1 class="role-lof-title">List of Figures</h1></section><section class="role-lot" id="lot"><h1 class="role-lot-title">List of Tables</h1><ul class="role-booklist-entries"><li class="role-booklist-entry"><a class="role-table-ref" href="#SimModels__lot__1"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2-1</span>. </span>Simulation Log</a></li><li class="role-booklist-entry"><a class="role-table-ref" href="#SimStatistics__lot__2"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2-2</span>. </span>Statistics</a></li></ul></section></div><section class="role-chapter" id="index"><h1 class="role-chapter-title"><span class="role-label">Chapter <span class="role-number">1</span>. </span>Introduction to Object Event Modeling of Activities</h1><p>This chapter shows how to make <em>activity-based Discrete Event Simulation models</em> using the paradigm of <em>Object Event Modeling and Simulation</em> (OEM&amp;S) with UML Class Diagrams and DPMN Process Diagrams.

In our second example this model is extended by adding two other resource types, <em>examination rooms</em> and <em>nurses</em>, and another type of activity: <em>walks to rooms</em> (the walks of patients to examination rooms guided by nurses).</p><section><h4>A basic conceptual model </h4><p>In our basic model of a medical department we consider just one activity, <em>medical examinations</em>, and one type of resource, <em>doctors</em>:</p><ul><li>Patients arrive at a medical department at random times.</li><li>If there are no other planned examinations waiting for the availability of a doctor, and a doctor is available, any newly arrived patient is immediately examined by that doctor. Otherwise, the planned examination of the newly arrived patient is added to a list of planned examinations (representing a queue).</li><li>The duration of examinations varies, depending on the individual case.</li><li>When an examination by a doctor is completed, the next planned examination is started by the doctor, if there is still any planned examination in the queue.</li></ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>object types</b> of the system under investigation are:</p><ul><li>patients,</li><li>medical departments,</li><li>doctors.</li></ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>event types</b> are:</p><ul><li>patient arrivals,</li><li>examination starts,</li><li>examination ends,</li></ul><p>Instead of considering the event types <em>examination starts</em> and <em>examination ends</em>, we can consider the activity type <em>examinations</em>. Thus, we get the following conceptual information model (expressed as an OEM Class Diagram, which is a special type of UML class diagram):</p><figure id="CM__figServiceDesk0"><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CIM1.svg" width="600" /></div></figure><p>From the diagram we can infer that:</p><ul><li>For <em>patient arrivals</em> and for <em>examinations</em>, there is an association with <em>medical departments</em> providing the <em>process owner</em>, such that for any <em>patient arrival</em> event and <em>examination</em> activity a specific <em>medical department</em> is in charge of handling the event or seeing to it that the activity is going to be performed.</li><li>While <em>patient arrivals</em> have two participants: a <em>patient</em> and a <em>medical department</em>, <em>examinations</em> have three participants: a <em>patient</em>, a <em>medical department</em> and a <em>doctor</em>.</li><li><em>Examinations</em> have one resource role, <em>doctor</em>, with a resource constraint of exactly one, which means that exactly one <em>doctor</em> is required for performing an <em>examination</em>.</li><li>The process owner of an <em>examination</em>, a <em>medical department</em>, has a resource pool for <em>doctors</em>. The <em>doctors</em> needed for performing <em>examinations</em> at this department are allocated from this pool, and the department, as the process owner of <em>examinations</em>, has a business procedure for allocating <em>doctors</em> to planned <em>examinations</em> (using certain policies).</li></ul><p>In addition to a conceptual information model, which captures the system's state structure, we also need to make a conceptual process model that captures the dynamics of the system. A process model can be expressed with the help of <em>event rules</em>, which define what happens when an event (of a certain type) occurs, or, more specifically, which <em>state changes</em> and which <em>follow-up events</em> are caused by an event of that type.</p><p>The following conceptual process model (in the form of a DPMN Process Diagram) is based on the information model above. It refers to a medical department as the <em>process owner</em>, visualized in the form of a Pool container rectangle, and to <i>doctor objects</i>, as well as to the event type <i>patient arrivals</i> and to the activity type <i>examinations</i>.</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CPM1.svg" width="600" /></div></figure><p>This conceptual process model describes two causal regularities in the form of the following two event rules, each stated with two bullet points: one for describing the state changes and one for describing the follow-up events brought about by applying the rule.</p><ol><li><p>When a new patient arrives:</p><ul><li>if a doctor is available, then she is allocated to the examination of that patient; otherwise, a new planned examination is queued up;</li><li>if a doctor has been allocated, then start an examination of the patient.</li></ul></li><li><p>When an examination is completed by a doctor:</p><ul><li>if the queue of planned examinations is empty, then the doctor is released;</li><li>otherwise, the next planned examination by that doctor starts immediately.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Since the resource management logic in this example complies with the standard resource management procedures, we can simplify the model by using a <em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em> arrow between the event type circle <em>patient arrivals</em> and the activity type rectangle <em>examinations</em> for expressing the assumption of the standard resource management logic built into OES Core 2, as shown in the following DPMN process diagram: </p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CPM1a.svg" width="300" /></div></figure></section><section><h4>An extended conceptual model </h4><p>For being more realistic, we consider the fact that patients first need to be walked by nurses to the room allocated to their examination before the examination can start. So, in our extended model of a medical department we consider two other resource types, <em>examination rooms</em> and <em>nurses</em>, and another type of activity: <em>walks to rooms</em> (the walks of patients to examination rooms guided by nurses):</p><ul><li>Patients arrive at a medical department at random times.</li><li>When a new patient arrives, and an examination room and a nurse are available, that nurse walks the patient to that room, otherwise the patient has to wait for the availability of an examination room and a nurse (administratively, a new planned walk is added to the queue/list of planned walks).</li><li>When a nurse has walked a patient to a room and a doctor is available, an examination of the patient by that doctor in the room starts; otherwise the patient has to wait for the availability of a doctor (administratively, a new planned examination is placed in the queue/list of planned examinations).</li><li><p>When an examination of a patient by a doctor in a room is completed,</p><ol><li>if there is still another planned examination of a patient waiting in a room for the availability of a doctor, the doctor goes to that room and starts the examination of that patient; otherwise, the planned examination of the newly arrived patient is added to a list of planned examinations (representing a queue);</li><li>if there is still another planned walk of a patient to a room waiting for the availability of a room, the room is allocated to this planned walk; if a nurse is available, she walks the patient to that room.</li></ol></li><li>The duration of walks and examinations varies, depending on the individual case.</li></ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>object types</b> of the system under investigation are: <em>patients</em>, <em>medical departments</em>, <em>rooms</em>, <em>nurses</em> and <em>doctors</em>.</p><p>The potentially relevant <b>event types</b> are <em>patient arrivals</em> and the activity types <em>walks to rooms</em> and <em>examinations</em>.</p><p>Thus, we get the following conceptual information model expressed as an OEM Class Diagram:</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CIM2.svg" width="600" /></div></figure><p>Notice that in this model, (a) the performer resource role is explicitly marked with Â«performerÂ»: a <em>nurse</em> is a performer of <em>walks to rooms</em> while a <em>doctor</em> is a performer of <em>examinations</em>, and (b) the stereotypes Â«resource roleÂ» and Â«resource poolÂ» have been abbreviated by Â«rrÂ» and Â«rpÂ». </p><p>From the diagram we can infer that:</p><ul><li>For the event type <em>patient arrivals</em> and for the activity types <em>walks to rooms</em> and <em>examinations</em>, there is an association with <em>medical departments</em> providing the <em>process owner</em>.</li><li>While <em>patient arrivals</em> have two participants: a <em>patient</em> and a <em>medical department</em>, <em>walks</em> and <em>examinations</em> have four participants: a <em>medical departmen</em>t, a <em>patient</em>, a <em>nurse</em> or a <em>doctor</em>, and a <em>room</em>.</li><li><em>Walks</em> have two resource roles, <em>nurse</em> and <em>room</em>, both with a resource constraint of exactly one, which means that exactly one <em>nurse</em> and one <em>room</em> are required for performing a <em>walk</em>.</li><li><em>Examinations</em> have two resource roles, <em>doctor</em> and <em>room</em>, both with a resource constraint of exactly one.</li><li>The process owner of a <em>walk to a room</em> and a subsequent <em>examination</em>, a <em>medical department</em>, has three resource pools for <em>nurses</em>, <em>rooms</em> and <em>doctors</em>. All required resources needed for performing <em>walks to room</em> and <em>examinations</em> at this department are allocated from these pools, and the department has corresponding business procedures for allocating rooms, nurses and doctors using certain allocation policies.</li></ul><p>In addition to a conceptual information model, which captures the system's state structure, we also need to make a conceptual process model that captures the dynamics of the system. A process model can be expressed with the help of event rules, which define what happens when an event (of a certain type) occurs, or, more specifically, which state changes and which follow-up events are caused by an event of that type.</p><p>The following conceptual process model (in the form of a DPMN Process Diagram) is based on the information model above. It refers to the object types <i>medical departments</i> and <i>doctors</i>, as well as to the event type <i>patient arrivals</i> and to the activity type <i>examinations</i>.</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CPM2.svg" width="800" /></div></figure><p>This process model describes three causal regularities in the form of the following three event rules:</p><ol><li><p>When a new patient arrives:</p><ul><li>if a room and a nurse are available, they are allocated to the walk of that patient to that room, otherwise a new planned walk is placed in the corresponding queue;</li><li>if a room has been allocated, then the nurse starts walking the patient to the room.</li></ul></li><li><p>When a walk of a patient and nurse to a room is completed:</p><ul><li>if there is still a planned walk in the queue and a room is available, then the room is allocated and the nurse is re-allocated to the walk of the next patient to that room.<br />if a doctor is available, she is allocated to the examination of that patient, else a new planned examination of that patient is queued up;</li><li>if a doctor has been allocated, then the examination of that patient starts<br />if the nurse has been re-allocated, she starts walking the next patient to the allocated room.</li></ul></li><li><p>When an examination of a patient is completed by a doctor in a particular room:</p><ul><li>if there is still a planned examination (of another patient in another room), then re-allocate the doctor to that planned examination, else release the doctor;<br />if the waiting line is not empty, re-allocate the room to the next patient, else release the room;</li><li>if the doctor has been re-allocated to a planned examination, that examination starts;<br />if the room has been re-allocated to another patient, that patient starts walking to the room.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Since, again, the resource management logic in this example complies with the standard resource management procedures built into OES Core 2, we can simplify the model by using <em>Resource-Dependent Activity Start</em> arrows resulting in an <i>Activity Network</i> model, as shown in the following DPMN process diagram:</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CPM2a.svg" width="500" /></div></figure></section></section><section class="role-section1" id="DesM"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.2</span>. </span>Making Simulation Design Models</h2><p>When making a simulation design based on a conceptual model of the system under investigation, we may abstract away from certain items of the conceptual model for obtaining a sufficiently simple design. The right degree of abstraction depends on the purpose of the model.</p><p>In our example of a medical department, the purpose of the simulation model is to compute the <em>maximum queue length</em> and the <em>resource utilization</em> for all types of activities. So, we may abstract away from the object type <em>patients</em> since we don't need any information about individual patients. If we don't need utilization statistics per doctor, but only the average utilization of all doctors, then we may also abstract away from the object type <i>doctors</i> This is the approach chosen in our design models <i>Medical-Department-0</i> and <i>Medical-Department-1</i>, while we keep the object type <i>doctors</i> for modeling individual doctors in the design model <i>Medical-Department-2</i>.</p><p>Since we abstract away from individual patients, we rename <i>patient arrival</i> events to <i>NewCase</i> events, each of them representing a new case for an examination to be planned and performed.</p><p>The event type <i>NewCase</i> is a type of exogenous events,<a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__1"></a> which are not caused by any causal regularity of the system under investigation and, therefore, have to be modeled with a recurrence<a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__2"></a> function that allows to compute the time of the next occurrence of an event of that type.</p><section><h4>1.2.1.Â Design models based on the basic conceptual model</h4><p>We model the random variations of two variables, the recurrence of new cases and the duration of examinations, in the form of random variables<a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__3"></a> as special class-level (&quot;static&quot;) functions, with a stereotype Â«rvÂ», in the class to which they belong, as shown in the diagrams below.</p><p>The recurrence of <i>NewCase</i> events is modeled as a random variable with an exponential distribution having an event rate of 0.7 per minute. The duration of examinations is modeled as a random variable with a uniform distribution having lower bound 5 and upper bound 9.</p><section><h5>The Medical-Department-1a design model</h5><p>In the <a href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core2/Medical-Department-1a/index.html">Medical-Department-1a</a> information design model, instead of using the built-in generic resource management logic, we explicitly model the resource management of doctors with the help of a counter variable for available doctors in the form of an attribute <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i>, and the operations <i>isDoctorAvailable()</i>, <i>allocateDoctor()</i> and <i>releaseDoctor()</i>, in the <i>MedicalDepartment</i> class:</p><figure><div><img alt="???" src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CIM1-IDM1a.svg" width="500" /></div></figure><p>The <i>isDoctorAvailable</i> function simply tests if <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i> &gt; 0, while the procedures <i>allocateDoctor</i> and <i>releaseDoctor</i> decrement and increment the <i>nmrOfAvailableDoctors</i> counter.</p><p>In addition to an information design model for defining the simulation's state structure, we also need to make a process design model for defining the dynamics of the simulation. The following DPMN process diagram defines two event rules:</p><figure><div><img src="tutorial_files/MedDep_CPM1-PDM0.svg" /></div></figure><p>Notice that this process design model contains the entire resource management logic for (de-)allocating doctors to (from) examinations. Since standard resource management procedures can be defined in a generic way, this logic (and the related code) can be moved from example models to the simulator, as explained in the next section.</p><p>The following table shows the two event rules defined by the above DPMN diagram, expressed in pseudo-code.</p><table border="1" style="border-spacing:3px;width:100%;"><thead><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>ON (event type)</b></p></td><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>DO (event routine)</b></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>NewCase( <i>md</i>) @ t<br />with <i>md</i> : MedicalDepartment</p></td><td><pre>newExam = new Examination( md);

ServiceDesk.<b>labels</b> = {&quot;queueLength&quot;:&quot;qLen&quot;};  // for the log</pre><p>Notice that, in OESjs, object types are defined as subtypes of the pre-defined class <code>oBJECT</code>, from which they inherit an integer-valued <code>id</code> attribute and an optional <code>name</code> attribute. When a property has a <code>label</code> (defined by the class-level (map-valued) property <code>labels</code>), it is shown in the simulation log.</p><p>You can <a href="https://gwagner57.github.io/oes/js/Core1/Service-Desk-1/index.html" target="_top">run this <i>simulation</i> model</a> from the project's GitHub website.</p></section><section><h4>2.2.3. Event Types</h4><p>In OES, there is a distinction between two kinds of events:</p><ol><li>events that are <em>caused</em> by other event occurrences during a simulation run;</li><li><em>exogenous</em> events that seem to happen spontaneously, but may be caused by factors, which are external to the simulation model.</li></ol><p>Here is an example of an exogenous event type definition in OESjs-Core1:</p><pre>class <b>CustomerArrival</b> extends eVENT {
  constructor({ occTime, serviceDesk}) {
    super( occTime);
    this.<b>serviceDesk</b> = serviceDesk;
  }
  onEvent() {
    ...
  }
  createNextEvent() {
    ...
  }
  static recurrence() {
    ...
  }
}</pre><p>The definition of the <i>CustomerArrival</i> event type includes a reference property <i>serviceDesk</i>, which is used for referencing the service desk object at which a customer arrival event occurs. In OESjs, event types are defined as subtypes of the pre-defined class <code>eVENT</code>, from which they inherit an attribute <code>occTime</code>, which holds the occurrence time<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__4"></a> of an event. As opposed to objects, events do normally not have an ID, nor a name. </p><p>Each event type needs to define an <code>onEvent</code> method that implements the event rule for events of the defined type. Event rules are discussed below. </p><p>Exogenous events occur periodically. They are therefore defined with a <em>recurrence</em> function,<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__5"></a> which provides the time in-between two events (often in the form of a random variable). The recurrence function is defined as a class-level (&quot;static&quot;) method:</p><pre>class CustomerArrival extends eVENT {
  ...
  static <b>recurrence</b>() {
    return math.getUniformRandomInteger( 1, 6);
  }
}</pre><p>Notice that the <i>recurrence</i> function of <i>CustomerArrival</i> is coded with the library method <code class="code">math.getUniformRandomInteger</code>, which allows sampling from discrete uniform probability distribution functions. </p><p>In the case of an exogenous event type definition, a <i>createNextEvent</i> method has to be defined for assigning event properties and returning the next event of that type, which is scheduled by invoking the <i>recurrence</i> function for setting its <i>ocurrenceTime</i> and by copying all participant references (such as the <i>serviceDesk</i> reference). </p><pre>class CustomerArrival extends eVENT {
  ...
  <b>createNextEvent</b>() {
    return new CustomerArrival({
      occTime: this.occTime + CustomerArrival.<b>recurrence</b>(),
      serviceDesk: this.serviceDesk
    });
  }
}</pre><p>The second event type of the <i>Service-Desk-1</i> model, <i>Departure</i>, is an example of a type of <i>caused</i> events:</p><pre>class <b>CustomerDeparture</b> extends eVENT {
  constructor({ occTime, serviceDesk}) {
    super( occTime);
    this.serviceDesk = serviceDesk;
  }
  onEvent() {
    ...
  }
}</pre></section><section><h4>2.2.4. Event Rules</h4><p>An event rule<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__6"></a> for an event type defines what happens when an event of that type occurs, by specifying the caused state changes and follow-up events. In OESjs, event rules are coded as <code>onEvent</code> methods of the class that implements the event type. These methods return a set of events (more precisely, a set of JS objects representing events).</p><p>Notice that in the DES literature, event rule methods are called <i>event routines</i><a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__7"></a>.</p><p>For instance, in the <code>CustomerArrival</code> class, the following event rule method is defined:</p><pre>class <b>CustomerArrival</b> extends eVENT {
  ...

Consequently, a simulator (like OESjs) must be able to process simultaneous events.<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__8"></a> In particular, simulation models based on discrete time may create simulation states where two or more events occur at the same time, but the model's logic requires them to be processed in a certain order. Defining priorities for events of a certain type helps to control the processing order of simultaneous events.</p><p>Consider an example model based on discrete time with three exogenous event types <i>StartOfMonth</i>, <i>EachDay</i> and <i>EndOfMonth</i>, where the recurrence of StartOfMonth and EndOfMonth is 21, and the recurrence of EachDay is 1. In this example we want to control that on simulation time 1 + <i>i</i> * 21 both a StartOfMonth and an EachDay event occur simultaneously, but StartOfMonth should be processed before EachDay, and on simulation time 21 + <i>i</i> * 21 both an EndOfMonth and an EachDay event occur simultaneously, but EndOfMonth should be processed after EachDay. This can be achieved by defining a high priority, say 2, to StartOfMonth, a middle priority, say 1, to StartOfMonth, and a low priority, say 0, to EndOfMonth. </p><p>Event priorities are defined as class-level properties of event classes in the event type definition file. Thus, we would define in <kbd>StartOfMonth.js</kbd>:</p><pre>StartOfMonth.priority = 2;</pre><p>and in <kbd>EachDay.js</kbd>:</p><pre>EachDay.priority = 1;</pre><p>and finally in <kbd>EndOfMonth.js</kbd>:</p><pre>EndOfMonth.priority = 0;</pre></section><section><h4>2.2.6.

};
// ***** Ex-Post Statistics *****************
sim.model.statistics = {...};</pre><p>We briefly discuss each group of scenario information items in the following sub-sections.</p><section><h4>2.3.1. Model Parameters</h4><p>While model variables are state variables whose values are changed as an effect of an event occurrence, <em>model parameters</em> are not part of the dynamic state of the simulated system, but are rather used for providing values that can only be read during a simulation run. The main purpose of model parameters is to allow <em>parameter variation experiments</em>.</p></section><section><h4>2.3.2. Simulation Scenario Parameters</h4><p>A few simulation parameters are predefined as attributes of the simulation scenario. The most important ones are:</p><ul><li><i>durationInSimTime</i> - this attribute allows defining the duration of a simulation run; which runs forever when this attribute s not set;</li><li><i>randomSeed</i>: Setting this optional parameter to a positive integer allows to obtain a specific fixed random number sequence (generated by a random number generator). This can be used for performing simulation runs with the same (repeated) random number sequence, e.g., for testing a simulation model by checking if expected results are obtained.</li></ul></section><section id="SimScenarios__sectInitialState"><h4>2.3.3. Initial State</h4><p>Defining an initial state means:</p><ol><li>assigning initial values to global model variables, if there are any;</li><li>defining which objects exist initially, and assigning initial values to their properties;</li><li>defining which events are scheduled initially.</li></ol><p>A <code>setupInitialState</code> procedure takes care of these initial state definitions. A global model variable is initialized in the following way: </p><pre>sim.scenario.setupInitialState = function () {
  // <b>Initialize model variables</b>
  <b>sim.model.v.queueLength</b> = 0;
  // Create initial objects
  ...
  // Schedule initial events
  ...
};</pre><p>An initial state object is created by instantiating an object type of the simulation model with suitable initial property values, as shown in the following example:</p><pre>sim.scenario.setupInitialState = function () {
  // Initialize model variables
  ...
  // <b>Create initial objects</b>
  let <b>serviceDesk1</b> = new ServiceDesk({id: 1, queueLength: 0});
  // Schedule initial events
  ...
};</pre><p>Notice that object IDs are positive integers, but when used as keys in the map <code>sim.objects</code>, they are converted to strings.</p><p>Instead of assigning a <strong>fixed value</strong> to a property like <code>queueLength</code> for defining an object's initial state, as in <code>queueLength: 0</code>, we can also assign it a <strong>fixed expression</strong>, as in <code>queueLength: Math.round(12/30)</code>.</p><p>An <strong>initial event</strong> is scheduled by adding it to the <em>Future Events List (FEL)</em>, as shown in the following example:</p><pre>sim.scenario.setupInitialState = function () {
  // Initialize model variables
  ...
  // Create initial objects
  let desk1 = new ServiceDesk({id: 1, queueLength: 0});
  // <b>Schedule initial events</b>
  sim.<b>FEL.add</b>( <b>new CustomerArrival</b>({occTime:1, serviceDesk: desk1}));
};</pre><p>Initial objects or events can be parametrized with the help of model parameters.</p></section><section><h4>2.3.4. Defining Alternative Scenarios with Different Initial States</h4><p>For running a model on top of different initial states, one can define a list of scenarios, each with its own <code>setupInitialState</code> procedure: </p><pre>sim.<b>scenarios[1]</b> = {
  scenarioNo: 1,
  title: &quot;Scenario with two service desks&quot;,
  setupInitialState: function () {
    // Create initial objects
    var sD1 = new ServiceDesk({id: 1, queueLength: 0}),
        sD2 = new ServiceDesk({id: 2, queueLength: 0});
    // Schedule initial events
    sim.FEL.add( new CustomerArrival({occTime: 1, serviceDesk: sD1}));
    sim.FEL.add( new CustomerArrival({occTime: 2, serviceDesk: sD2}));
  }
};
sim.<b>scenarios[2]</b> = {...}</pre><p>Before running a simulation, a specific scenario can be chosen in the user interface.</p><blockquote class="role-warning"><p>Do not set model parameters in the <code>setupInitialState</code> procedure! This would interfere with parameter variation experiments in which the same parameter(s) are used.</p></blockquote></section></section><section class="role-section1" id="SimStatistics"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.4</span>. </span>Statistics</h2><p>In scientific and engineering simulation projects the main goal is getting estimates of the values of certain variables or performance indicators with the help of statistical methods. In educational simulations, statistics can be used for observing simulation runs and for learning the dynamics of a simulation model. </p><p>For collecting statistics, suitable <em>statistics variables</em> have to be defined, as in the following example:</p><pre>sim.model.<b>setupStatistics</b> = function () {
  sim.stat.arrivedCustomers = 0;
  sim.stat.departedCustomers = 0;
  sim.stat.maxQueueLength = 0;
};</pre><p>Statistics variables have to be updated in <i>onEvent</i> methods. For instance, the variables <i>arrivedCustomers</i> and <i>maxQueueLength</i> are updated in the onEvent method of the <i>CustomerArrival</i> event class:</p><pre>class CustomerArrival extends eVENT {
  ...
  onEvent() {
    ...
    // update statistics
    sim.stat.<b>arrivedCustomers</b>++;
    if (this.serviceDesk.queueLength &gt; sim.stat.maxQueueLength) {
      sim.stat.<b>maxQueueLength</b> = this.serviceDesk.queueLength;
    }
    ...
  }
}</pre><p>In certain cases, a statistics variable can only be computed at the end of a simulation run. For this purpose, there is the option to define a <i>computeFinalStatistics</i> procedure:</p><pre>sim.model.<b>computeFinalStatistics</b> = function () {
  // percentage of business days without stock-outs
  sim.stat.serviceLevel = (sim.time - sim.stat.nmrOfStockOuts) / sim.time * 100;
};</pre><p>After running a simulation scenario, the statistics results are shown in a table:</p><table border="1" id="SimStatistics__lot__2"><caption><span class="role-label">Table <span class="role-number">2-2</span>. </span>Statistics</caption><tbody><tr><td>arrivedCustomers</td><td>289</td></tr><tr><td>departedCustomers</td><td>288</td></tr><tr><td>maxQueueLength</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section class="role-section1" id="SimExperiments"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.5</span>. </span>Simulation Experiments</h2><p>There are different types of simulation experiments. In a <em>simple experiment</em>, a simulation scenario is run repeatedly by defining a number of replications (iterations) for being able to compute average statistics.</p><p>In a <em>parameter variation experiment</em>, several variants of a simulation scenario (called <em>experiment scenarios</em>), are defined by defining value sets for certain <em>model parameters</em> (the <em>experiment parameters</em>), such that a parameter variation experiment run consists of a set of experiment scenario runs, one for each combination of parameter values.</p><p>An experiment type is defined for a given simulation model and an experiment of that type is run on top of a given simulation scenario for that model.</p><p>When running an experiment, the resulting statistics data are stored in a database, which allows looking them up later on or exporting them to data analysis tools (such as Microsoft Excel and RStudio)</p><section><h4>2.6.1.
