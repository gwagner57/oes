     <li>going to the loading site (an activity performed by trucks),</li>
     <li>loading (an activity performed by the wheel loader using a truck as a resource),</li>
     <li>hauling (an activity performed by trucks),</li>

  class="expl" id="expl-IDM"></div> <p>In the current simulation project, the purpose of the simulation model is to compute two statistics: the
  <em>service utilization</em> and <em>the maximum queue length</em>. We may therefore abstract away from many of the object types from the conceptual
  information model:</p> <ul>
      <li><code>Customer</code>: we don't need any information about individual customers;</li>
      <li><code>ServiceQueue</code>: we don't need to know who is next, it's sufficient to know <em>the length of the queue</em>;</li>
      <li><code>ServiceDesk</code>: we don't need any information about the service desks, the information if <em>the service desk is busy</em> or not
      is obtained by testing if the queue's length is greater than 0.</li>
      <li><code>ServiceClerk</code>: we don't need any information about service clerks.</li>
    </ul><p>Consequently, a computational design for the purpose of computing the two statistics <em>maximum queue length</em> and <em>service
  utilization</em> is obtained by modeling only one object type: <b><code>ServiceDesk</code></b> with one (integer-valued) attribute
  <code>queueLength</code>. The varying duration of a service is modeled with a function <code>serviceDuration()</code> representing a random variable
  based on an empirical probability distribution function with a probability of 30% for the value 2, 50% for 3 and 20% for 4 (time units),
  symbolically expressed as <i>Freq(</i> 2:0.3, 3:0.5, 4:0.2<i>)</i>.</p><p>Concerning the event types described in the conceptual information model,
  the goal is to keep only those of them, which are really needed, in the design model. This question is closely related to the question, which types
  of state changes and follow-up event creation have to be modeled for being able to answer the research question(s).</p><p>In the case of the given
  two research questions, we need to keep track of changes of the queue length and we need to be able to add up the service durations. For keeping
  track of queue length changes, we need to consider all types of events that may change the queue length: <em>customer arrivals</em> and <em>customer
  departures</em>. For being able to add up the service durations, we need to catch <em>service start</em> and <em>service end
  events</em>.</p><p>After identifying the relevant event types, we can look for further simplification opportunities by analyzing their possible
  temporal coincidence. Clearly, we can consider customer departures to occur immediately after the corresponding service end events, without having
  any effects that could not be merged. Therefore, we can drop service end events, and take care of their effects (the cumulative service time
  computation) when handling the related customer departure event.</p><p>In addition, we can drop service start events, since they temporally coincide
  with customer arrivals when the queue is empty, or otherwise (when the queue is not empty) they coincide with service end (and, hence, with customer
  departure) events, because each service end event causes a new service start event as long as the queue is not empty.</p><p>As a result of the above
  considerations, we get the following two types of events:</p><ul>
      <li><b><code>CustomerArrival</code></b> with a reference property <code>serviceDesk</code> with range <code>ServiceDesk</code>. As an exogenous
      event type, <code>CustomerArrival</code> has a <code>recurrence</code> function representing a random variable for computing the time in-between
      two subsequent event occurrences. It is a design choice to use a uniform distribution function with lower bound 1 and upper bound 6,
      symbolically expressed as <i>U(</i> 1, 6<i>)</i>.</li>
      <li><b><code>CustomerDeparture</code></b> with a reference property <code>serviceDesk</code> with range <code>ServiceDesk</code>.</li>
    </ul><p>Notice that, for simplicity, we consider the customer that is currently being served to be part of the queue. In this way, in the
  simulation program, we can check if the service desk is busy by testing if the length of the queue is greater than 0.</p><p>An alternative approach
  would be not considering the currently served customer as part of the queue, but rather use a Boolean attribute <code>isBusy</code> for being able
  to keep track if the service desk is still busy with serving a customer.</p><p>The object types and event types described above, together with their
  participation associations ("service desks participate in customer arrival events and in customer departure events"), are visually described in the
  following UML class diagram:</p> <figure> <img src="media/img/IDM.svg" width="500" /> <figcaption>An information design model describing object
  types and event types.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Notice how functions representing random variables, like <code>serviceDuration()</code> and
  <code>recurrence()</code>, are marked with the keyword (or UML stereotype) «rv» standing for "random variable".</p> </section><section><h1>Process
