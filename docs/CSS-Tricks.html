  <body><h2>Animation for Simulation (draft version)<br /></h2><p>Animations
  are a fascinating topic for web designers, and there are several web
  technologies that support making animations. The simplest approach is
  defining declarative CSS animations: either with <em>CSS transitions</em>,
  allowing simple <em>from-to</em> value changes of CSS properties for
  creating corresponding visual effects, or <em>keyframe</em>-based animations
  with the CSS <em>animation</em> property allowing more powerful visual
  effects.</p><p>Even before CSS has introduced these animation features, it
  was possible to program animations of DOM elements with JavaScript. These
  procedural animations require more effort, though.</p><p>Simulation is an
  old topic in science and engineering, and it is also widely used in
  education and entertainment today. In fact, the development of the
  <em>Object-Oriented Programming</em> paradigm has been triggered by the
  simulation programming language <a
  href="https://sim4edu.com/explain/what-is-simula">Simula</a> that has
  invented the concepts of objects, classes and inheritance back in the
  1960's.<br /></p><p>Essentially, there are two different types of real-world
  systems and simulation approaches: <em>continuous</em> systems/simulations
  and <em>discrete </em>systems/simulations. While physical, and many
  technical, systems are essentially characterized by <em>continuous state
  changes</em> of their objects, biological and social systems, as well as
  many technical (in particular digital) systems, are essentially
  characterized by <em>discrete state changes</em> of their objects.</p><p>In
  continuous simulation, state changes are modeled with the help of algebraic
  and <em>differential equations</em>, and a simulator uses solvers for
  computing approximate solutions. Discrete state changes of objects can be
  modeled with the help of <em>event-based simulation</em>.</p><p>For a given
  simulation model, it is often desirable to add a visualization of its
  simulation runs. Such a visualization is very similar to a JS animation.
  However, the changes of visual properties of user interface elements do not
  have to be explicitly programmed, but, rather, they are provided by the
  simulation.</p><p>We show how a CSS-based web animation can be added to a
  given simulation model, using the Open Source front-end JS simulation
  framework <a href="https://sim4edu.com/oesjs/core1/">OESjs</a>. As an
  example of a simulation model, we use the model of a lemonade
  stand.</p><section><h3>Modeling a Lemonade Stand as a Single-Product
  Manufacturing Company</h3><p>A lemonade seller makes lemonade in pitchers
  and sells it in paper cups at a stand in a street market. Each day consists
  of the following process steps and phases:</p><ol>
      <li>The day starts at 8 am with making planning decisions (demand
      forecasting based on the weather forecast, production planning and sales
      price planning) and ordering the input materials (lemons, sugar, etc.)
      required for production and for refilling the inventory.</li>

      <li>While the ordered ice cubes will be delivered within two hours, the
      other items may be delivered later on that day or on the next day.</li>

      <li>At 11 am, the planned quantity of lemonade is produced and the stand
      is opened.</li>

      <li>Then, customers arrive randomly and order a cup of lemonade. The
      nicer the weather is, the more customers show up. As long as there is
      still lemonade in stock, customer orders are served.</li>

      <li>At the end of the day, the lemonade stand is closed and the
      remaining lemonade and expired inventory items are dumped.</li>
    </ol><p>This system narrative can be turned into a general simulation
  model of single-product manufacturing companies with the following object
  and event types. Object types: SingleProductCompany, InputItemType,
  OutputItemType, ProductCategory, LemonadeMarket. Event types: StartOfDay,
  Delivery, DailyProduction, DailyDemand, EndOfDay.</p><p>The OESjs model is
  available as <a
  href="https://sim4edu.com/oesjs/core1/lemonade-stand-2/">Lemonade-Stand-2</a>.</p></section><section><h3>Visualizing
  the Operation of a Lemonade Stand</h3><p>OESjs allows adding a declarative
  SVG/CSS-based visualization/animation to a given simulation model. The
  essential principles of its approach are:</p><ol>
      <li>The objects of the simulation model are visualized, or animated, by
      defining <em><strong>object views</strong></em>, which consist of one or
      more SVG elements with CSS styles, such that certain object properties
      are mapped to SVG element attributes.</li>

      <li>The events of the simulation model are visualized by defining
      <em><strong>event views</strong></em>, which consist of keyframe-based
      CSS animations.</li>
    </ol><p>Since my graphics/design skills are quite limited, I've only be
  able to define a pretty simple animation, as shown in the following figure
  (recorded in the form of an animated GIF).</p><figure><img
  alt="A visualization of the operation of a lemonade stand." height="392"
  src="https://sim4edu.com/oesjs/core1/lemonade-stand-2/img/Animation.gif"
  width="719" /></figure><p>As you may have recognized, the animation consists
  of two fixed elements that don't change: the table of the lemonade stand and
  its pitcher. Both are defined in the form of simple SVG elements:</p><pre>sim.config.ui.obs.fixedElements = {
  "lemonadeStandTable": {
    shapeName: "polygon",  // an SVG shape name
    // defining fixed values for the attributes of an SVG shape
    shapeAttributes: {points: "400,200 400,210 ... 180,210 180,200"},
    // CSS style rules for the SVG element
    style: "fill:brown; stroke-width:0"
  },
  "lemonadePitcher": {
    shapeName: "polyline",
    shapeAttributes: {points: "200,125 200,200 250,200 250,125"},
    style: "fill:none; stroke:black; stroke-width:3"
  }
};</pre><p>In addition to these fixed elements, I have added a view of the
  "lemonadeStand" object. This object view definition maps two properties to
  SVG attributes: (1) the <em>stockQuantity</em> of the stand's
  <em>productType</em> (the quantity of lemonade), and (2) the
  <em>dailyProfit</em> of the stand. The view consists of 5 SVG elements: a
  <em>rect</em> element and two text elements for mapping the
  <em>productType.stockQuantity</em> property to the height of a yellow
  rectangle representing the lemonade quantity and its textual display, and a
  <em>rect</em> element and a text element for mapping the
  <em>dailyProfit</em> property to the height of a rectangle filled with $
  coins and its textual display.<br /></p><pre>sim.config.ui.obs.objectViews = {
  "lemonadeStand": {  // a view for the object "lemonadeStand"
    visualizationAttributes: ["productType.stockQuantity","dailyProfit"],
    attributesViewItemsRecords: [
      { attributes:["productType.stockQuantity"],
        viewItems: [  // a list of view item definition records for the object/attribute
          {shapeName: "rect",  // an SVG shape name
            style: "fill:yellow; stroke-width:0",  // CSS style rules for the SVG element
            // attribute-value slots of an SVG shape, using fixed values or expressions
            shapeAttributes: {
              // defining fixed values for the attributes of an SVG shape
              x: 205, width: 40,
              // using expressions for defining the values of shape attributes
              y: stand =&gt; 195 - stand.productType.stockQuantity,
              // the parameter "stand" represents a LemonadeStand object
              height: stand =&gt; stand.productType.stockQuantity
            }
          },
          {shapeName: "text",  // text elements are treated like shapes
            style:"font-size:10px; text-anchor:middle",  // CSS text style rules
            shapeAttributes: {
              x: 225, y: 195,  // coordinates for positioning the text
              textContent: stand =&gt; stand.productType.stockQuantity + " L"
            }
          },
          {shapeName: "text",  // text elements are treated like shapes
            style:"font-size:20px; text-anchor:middle",  // CSS text style rules
            shapeAttributes: {
              x: 50, y: 50,  // coordinates for positioning the text
              textContent: () =&gt; sim.time ? "Day "+ Math.ceil( sim.time / 24) : ""
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      { attributes:["dailyProfit"],
        viewItems: [
          {shapeName: "rect",
            style:"stroke-width:0",
            fillPatternImage:{id:"fp1", file:"Dollar-Coin.svg"},
            shapeAttributes: { x: 300, width: 60,
              y: stand =&gt;  195 - Math.floor( stand.dailyProfit / 2),
              height: stand =&gt;  Math.floor( stand.dailyProfit / 2)
            }
          },
          {shapeName: "text",
            style:"font-size:10px; text-anchor:middle",  // CSS text style rules
            shapeAttributes: {
              x: 375, y: 195,
              textContent: stand =&gt; stand.dailyProfit &gt; 0 ? "$"+ Math.floor( stand.dailyProfit) : ""
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },</pre><p>In addition to the animation of the lemonade stand, there is also
  an animation of the weather state (sunny, partly cloudy, etc.), which is a
  property of the <em>LemonadeMarket</em> object, and animations of the
  DailyDemand and EndOfDay events.</p><p>As you have noticed by looking at
  this code, you can easily improve this animation simply by defining SVG
  elements and their CSS styling in the case of object views, and
  keyframe-based CSS animations in the case of event
  views.<br /></p></section></body>
