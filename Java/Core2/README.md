# OES Java Core 2 Simulator 

The OESjs Core 2 simulator implements an architecture for Object Event Simulation (OES) that extends the OESjs Core 1 simulator by adding support for activities, which may be resource-constrained.


# How to start the simulation application

1. Run start.sh script for creating a docker container with Postgres-DB
2. Execute the command `mvn spring-boot:run` in the root folder.

Now you can navigate to http://localhost:8080 and choose one of the available simulations.
