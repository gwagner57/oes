		<h2>OESjs Core 2</h2>
		<p class="description">The OESjs Core 2 simulator implements an architecture for Object Event Simulation (OES) that extends the OESjs Core 1 simulator by adding support for activities, which may be resource-constrained.</p>

			<p> This example explicitly models the resource management of doctors with the help of a counter variable for available doctors in the form of an attribute nmrOfAvailableDoctors, 
			and the operations isDoctorAvailable(), allocateDoctor() and releaseDoctor(), in the MedicalDepartment class. </p> </li>
			
			<li><a href="/core2/medical-department-1b">Medical-department-1b</a>: 
			<p> This model is essentially the same as Medical-Department-1a, except that it uses the generic resource management logic that is built into OES Core 2. 
			The resource pool doctors is modeled as a count pool, which abstracts away from individual resources and only counts them. </p> </li>
			
			<li><a href="/core2/medical-department-1c">Medical-department-1c</a>: 
			<p> In this model, the resource pool doctors is modeled as an individual resource pool instead of a count pool. 
			This allows making the model more realistic, for instance, by assigning an individual work schedule to each doctor defining her availability. </p> </li>
			
				<li><a href="/core2/medical-department-2a">Medical-department-2a</a>: 
			<p> This model includes two activity types: WalkToRoom activities involve a room and are performed by a nurse, 
			while Examination activities involve a room and are performed by a doctor. 
			The resource pools nurses and doctors are modeled as individual resource pools, while the resource pool rooms, 
			which is used by both WalkToRoom and Examination activities, is modeled as a count pool. </p> </li>
			
			<li><a href="/core2/medical-department-2b">Medical-department-2b</a>: 
			<p> This model is the same as Medical-Department-2a, except that Examination activities require a room, two nurses and a doctor. </p> </li>
